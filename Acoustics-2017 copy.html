<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Introduction</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The course of Applied Acoustics is an introductory course to a scientific and technological field undergoing a very rapid development, which offers great employment opportunities, and which involves disciplines apparently very different: architecture, structural engineering, physiology, psychology, statistics, physics, electronics, vibration mechanics, fluid dynamics, digital signal processing, telecommunications, measurements, hygiene of the workplace, music, musicology, virtual reality.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Obviously in a post-graduate course of 6 CFUs we can only provide the methodological basis of Applied Acoustics which must then be further studied in more advanced courses, such as courses for Competent Technicians in Environmental Acoustics (typically 3-6 months) or Master Courses (1 year) available at some Italian universities, or even dedicated post-graduate degrees (2 years, for example the <a href="http://ispg.deib.polimi.it/musicalacoustics.html"><span class="s13">post-graduate (advanced) degree in </span></a><a href="http://suono.como.polimi.it/"><span class="s13">Musical Acoustics</span></a> of Politecnico di Milano).</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Because of its multidisciplinary and transversal nature, the Course of Applied Acoustics is attended by students from various degree programs (almost all branches of Engineering, but also students of Architecture and Physics).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">For students of all branches of engineering this is a key course, it is practically the only opportunity to see (or, rather, hear) the techniques learned in previous courses, in which the purely theoretical foundations of modern advanced mathematical methods are taught. When the "numbers" are transformed in sound, abstruse and difficult mathematical procedures quickly become very clear and immediate, and the possibilities offered by sound editing systems on the PC, used extensively both during lectures and during laboratory exercises, make it possible to listen immediately (usually in real time) to the "effects" of filters or other devices (compressors, gates, convolvers, denoising, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Given the scientific interests of the teacher, the course covers both the noise-related topics common to all branches of engineering , and the more specific themes relative to the acoustics of theatres and cinemas, audio production in music and television / film, musical instruments, high fidelity recording and Stereo (1D), Surround (2D) and three-dimensional (3D, VR, AR) systems.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The topics are always presented with systematic help of test sounds, as this is the most direct way to make the various operations to be perceived.</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>EXAMPLE:</b></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Many students do not understand the physical meaning of "differentiation" and "integration" operators applied to a function. Math teachers tend to give "graphical" explanations , such as <b>"the derivative is the slope of a curve"</b> or <b>"the integral is the area under a curve."</b> These explanations are useless for those who are devoid of the capacity of visualisation needed to transform these concepts into images.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">In acoustics, the operations of differentiation or integration modify the spectrum of a sound. In particular, <b>differentiation boosts high frequencies</b> (increases the sound level of 6dB/octave). On the contrary, <b>integration boosts low frequencies.</b> Here's an example, which allows to "listen" to differentiation and integration applied to a recording of the human voice:</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Didactical Approach</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In academic year <a href="file:///Volumes/DiscoF/WWW/Acoustics-2014.htm"><span class="s13">2014/2015</span></a> a  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom"><span class="s13">Flipped Classroom</span></a>" method was adopted for the first time, and the experiment was repeated, with significant modifications, during academic year <a href="file:///Volumes/DiscoF/WWW/Acoustics-2015.htm"><span class="s13">2015/2016</span></a>. During the following year <a href="file:///Volumes/DiscoF/WWW/Acoustics-2016.htm"><span class="s13">2016/2017</span></a> this course was held temporarily by the visiting professor Filippo Maria Fazi, of the University of Southampton, UK. He did come back to traditional in-class didactics, but he retained some of the best outcomes of the Flipped Classroom experiments, such as the videorecording of the lessons and the in-class intermediate tests.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">During current academic year 2017/2018 we are back to traditional in-class lessons, but we retain a partial support of pre-recorded lessons which were recorded during previous years. A selection of these videorecordings is made available alongside with the <a href="file:///Volumes/DiscoF/WWW/Acoustics-2017-Lessons.htm"><span class="s19"><b>Progressive list of lessons</b></span></a>, together with other supportive didactical material (lesson notes, data files, charts, audio files, etc.).</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, these videolessons are NOT a teledidactic course. They are INSUFFICIENT for preparing properly the exam. An important part of the didactical activities are AUDIBLE EXPERIMENTS which are conducted in the classroom at every lesson, and which can only be experienced in physical presence in the classroom. Furthermore, a number of <b>in class-tests</b> are planned, but WITH NO PREVIOUS ADVICE. This means that only students who regularly come to lessons will have the possibility to take part to these frequent and very short in-class tests, and hence be progressively evaluated, with the goal of avoiding entirely the final exam.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Of course, students who cannot come regularly in classroom will have the possibility to study at home, and to make a traditional written+oral exam, but in this specific case this will result in a systematic handicap, affecting both the final preparation and the final score. So, if you cannot attend to a significant number of the in-class lessons and tests, it is warmly suggested to choose another course, if getting an high final score is a relevant expectation for you (it was not for me, when I was a student, however I see that for a number of students the score has some significance).</span></p>

        <p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>In-class tests: a didactical tool, more than an evaluation tool. Some hints:</b></span></p>
        <ol class="ol1">
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">The input data of the numerical problems are usually dependent on the 6 digits of the matricula number, which are "labelled" in sequence (ABCDEF). For example, if the Matricula number is 123456, then A=1, B=2, etc. - a typical input datum could be: L= 100+F*2 dB, which results in L=112 dB if F was 6. In some cases two digits are employed as a single number: L=100+EF dB results in L=156 dB, if E was 5 and F was 6. Please note, it is NOT the same as L=100+E*F dB, which would result in L=130 dB.</span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">The evaluation of the result is very rigid, as it is being performed by means of an Excel spreadsheet. So the results must be entered VERY EXACTLY: the number must be written <b>with the decimal point</b> (not with a comma); then there must be a <b>space</b>, and finally the <b>correct SI unit</b> (with proper smallcase/uppercase lettering). Examples: 93.5 dB(A) - 340.321 m/s - 5.68E-6 W/m2 - note that the number must follow the Excel notation.</span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">The correction is performed typically during the following lesson.</span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">In case of problems about the scores obtained, the student should ask for explanation by E-mail, and NOT during in-class activity.</span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">During the in-class test the students <b>are allowed</b>, and warmly encouraged, to employ <b>personal computing devices </b>(laptop, tablets, smartphones) also connected to the Internet. These can be used for doing calculations, for accessing the online didactical resources (slides, notes, tables, charts, Excel spreadsheets) and also for free search on the Internet (Wikipedia, internet repositories, etc.).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">However, these electronic devices <b>should not be abused</b>, employing social networks or other communication networks finalized to getting help in the solution of the problems. Students caught doing such unethical behaviour will be reported to academic authorities, and risk severe consequence, such as the complete cancelling of their entire academic career and the expulsion form the University of Parma. Students are warned of the high risk that these electronics devices can cause, so use them very carefully, because the risk is strongly exceeding the potential advantages that an unethical behaviour can provide.</span></li>
          <li class="li14"><span class="s1">Students making use of their personal computing devices are warmly encouraged to use them also for <b>submitting "online" the results of the tests</b>, by filling up a Google Form. The link to it will be provided just at the moment of the test, and will be deactivated after a few minutes, at the end of the test. For filling up the questionnaire each student must first login his web browser to Gmail, using his student's credentials (name.surname@studenti.unipr.it). The following link provides a test questionnaire, for checking your connectivity and your capability of compiling a Google Form properly:<br>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The final prize will be to </span><span class="s3">avoid the traditional written exam</span><span class="s1"> . And if the score of the in-class tests with be 25 or better, there will be the further prize of being allowed to choose the general topic for the final oral question.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s12"><b>Back to Top</b></span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1"><b>Method of Examination</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The method of examination is quite standard: a written test, based on exercises, followed by an oral final question, mostly theoretical. The oral question follows the written exam, but is always done the same day. This method is unchanged in the last 9 years.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">However, thanks to the in-class tests, it is expected that a significant number of students can be exempted from the written exam.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">These students will still have the possibility to improve their starting score, by making the written exam the same day as the final oral question, with the safety that, if the written exam results in a score lower than the score of the in-class test, <b>the latter will still be considered as the starting score </b>for the oral questions. In practice you can only get a better score, not worst; hence there is no risk attempting to improve your score with the written exam.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The written exam is made typically of 3 or 4 exercises, with numerical solution, similar to those of the in-class tests. It lasts one hour, the correction is immediate, and after this the students perform immediately the final oral question.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The final oral question is simple and short, an typically takes no more than 5 minutes. It causes a small variation (positive and negative) of the score already obtained with the written exam, which remains the most relevant part of the evaluationprocedure. Typically the final oral question gives a maximum variation of +/- 3 points, which only exceptionally can go up to +/5 points.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">If the total score exceeds 30, the "cum laude" is obtained automatically. It can also be given to students reaching exactly 30 points, if the oral exam was particularly brilliant.<br>
 </span></p>

      <td valign="middle" class="td1">
        <p class="p14"><span class="s1">All the students must be present at the nominative call at 09.00, and they must sign the presence sheet when called. Who misses this will not be verbalized, and hence he will have to repeat the exam during the following appeal. Who is late at the nominative call looses the right to be examined in that day.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">The written exercises are to be completed in an one-hour time limit, typically starting at 9.15, after the nominative call procedure is completed. After a few minutes for the correction of the exercises, the oral examinations start (typically around 10.30).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">For the written exam, the student is required to carry a pen and an handheld calculator, as well as charts, tables, notes, etc...<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">During the written exercises it is possible to employ all of the above material, including notes and/or textbooks; instead, during the final oral question, the student is not allowed to consult his/her notes or books, but he/she can still employ charts and tables - <b>so it is advisable to keep them separate from the notes</b>.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s3">The usage of computers, tablets, smartphones or the like is <b>strictly forbidden</b> during examinations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s3">If the student carries such devices with him/her, including cell phones or smartphones, <b>the devices must be kept switched off </b>(NOT just in standby mode) during the whole duration of the exam.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s3">Who infringes this rule will be immediately expelled from the classroom and consequently rejected, <b>even if the device was not being used</b>.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s3">Exception to this rule is allowed only for students with certified Learning Disabilities (LD, DSA in Italian), who are invited to contact the teacher before the exam, possibly by Email or in person, instead of passing through the LD Office "Le Eliche".</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">For the written exercises, each student is given two pieces of paper: the examination form, which includes the problems and there are spaces for writing the results, and one 4-faces "protocol" foil, where the student should write clearly the passages required for getting the solutions. Both sheets must carry, since the beginning of the exam, name, surname, matricula and signature of each student. It is forbidden to write on anything else than the "protocol" sheet: if one is not enough, additional "protocol" sheets can be asked to the examiner. All the "protocol" sheets must be given back together with the examination form.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">The written exercises typically provide a maximum score of 30 points. At least 15 points are required for passing the written exercises and being admitted to the subsequent oral question.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">For optimal training to the exercises, it is strongly <b>discouraged</b> to "study" the solution of already-solved problems. The only way to be trained correctly is by attempting to solve problems without any preliminary knowledge of the correct solution. For this, it can be useful to download the text of the problems which were employed in past years, which can be downloaded here:</span></p>

      <td valign="middle" class="td1">
        <p class="p14"><span class="s1">Each oral exam is typically shorter than 10 minutes. In most exam sessions, as the oral exams start around 10.30, all the students are examined before lunch. Only when the number of students is very large, some of them will be examined in the afternoon. It is generally not allowed to make the oral examination in a day different from the written exam, so the student should be trained to sustain both parts of the exam in the same day (except in the case of exemption from the written exam, as described earlier).</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">It is always <b>mandatory to satisfactorily answer to at least one oral question</b>, typically on theoretical topics, even for students who passed the written exercises or the in class tests with maximum score.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">The evaluation of the oral examination, which usually is positive, in some cases can provide a NEGATIVE score, reducing the score obtained in the written part. Normally a range of +/-3 points is available. Only in very exceptional cases this range can be expanded to +/- 5 points, based on the sole evaluation of the examiner.  And, independently from the sum of the scores, <b>if the oral examination is judged unsatisfactory, the student can always be rejected</b>.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">So students must train themselves to sustain a formal oral examination on theoretical topics, and are discouraged to only train on exercises. Please, note that an oral question is considered satisfactorily answered even if just a minimal answer is given, provided that the student proofs to know and use proper words (names) associated with the physical quantities, and to know the corresponding definitions, physical meaning and measurement units. It is NOT required to memorize complex formulas or numerical values, nor demonstrations; the student can consult his tables of formulas and values during the oral examination. Conversely, it is well appreciated to be equipped with a good set of tables and charts, proofing to be able to retrieve quickly the required information from them. During the oral examination it is not usually required to do numerical computations: however it is always useful to keep the handheld calculator at hand.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">Students of the Engineering and Physics courses are requested to use </span><span class="s3">English</span><span class="s1"> both for the written and oral parts of the examination. Students of Architecture can ask to make the oral exam in Italian, albeit doing it in English is appreciated and suggested.</span></p>
        <p class="p5"><span class="s1">For optimal training to the oral examinations, students are encouraged to assist to the previous session of exams.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

The purpose is to develop a new test method with very small invasiveness, aimed at locating structurally degraded areas in plaster, frescoes, mosaics, and other structures of historical value. The new method makes use of an "exponential sine sweep" signal, in order to operate with very low sound pressure level; an array of loudspeakers focuses sound waves, so that just a restricted area of the surface to be scanned is stressed, and an array of microphones (or a Laser-Doppler velocimeter) is employed in order to determine the vibrational response of a single point of the structure. The student must first operate a verification of the new method on artificial samples in laboratory, and then perform experimental tests "in situ" inside churches and other historic buildings in Parma.</span></p>

The goal is the development of a low-frequency Sonar system, operating in the audio field (1000-20000 Hz), broadband, in order to obtain a good penetration into the seabed and to view the soil stratigraphy below. The system uses an array of 16 hydrophones and an underwater loudspeaker fed with sine sweep signal. The student will have to make a series of tests in the laboratory, in the test tank and in the sea, in order to validate the operation of the system, and to process the results of the acquired traces in order to obtain three-dimensional images of the stratigraphy of the bottom.</span></p>

The purpose is to reactivate the "Acoustic Camera" system that was built four years ago, making use of high quality microphones and of a new portable hardware acquisition system, which should allow to be used outside the laboratory. The student must first reassemble the system and make it operational, then verify its performances through a series of measurements to be carried out both in the laboratory, and in industrial environment. If versed in programming, the student may also participate in the development of the new real timea software, that should replace the existing Matlab software, currently capable of "off line " processing only.</span></p>
