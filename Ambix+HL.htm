<p><font face="Arial">Starting in August 2018, Youtube
<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6395969?hl=en">supports a new 
hybrid format</a> for the spatial audio soundtrack embedded with panoramic 360 
videos, which contains 6 channels:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font face="Arial">the first 4 channels are traditional Ambix 1st order 
	(WYZX)</font></li>
	<li><font face="Arial">channels 5 and 6 contain headlocked stereo sound, 
	which is sent to headphones unprocessed during playback, without any 
	head-tracking effect</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Arial">When uploading videos to Youtube supporting this new 
6-channels format, the usage of a MOV container with uncompressed PCM audio, at 
48 kHz, 24 or 32 bits, is highly recommended for preserving the best sound 
quality.<br>
Google provides a <a href="https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases">new 
version of their Metadata Injector V. 2.1</a>, which now allows to specify that 
the video contains this new hybrid 6.channels audio track.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">A modified version of this new Metadata Injector has been 
released by Angelo Farina, supporting Ambix up to third order (16 channels) - 
this is not yet supported by Youtube, but can be enjoyed in local playback using
<a href="https://github.com/openbigdatagroup/vivecinema">Vive Cinema</a>,
<a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC Mediaplayer</a> or
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201111215748/https:/community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-VR-Player-for-desktop-FAQ/ta-p/394345">Gopro VR Player</a> apps. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here you can download this extended
<a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/Jump-Videos/spatial-media-2.1-HOA.zip">
High Order version of the Metadata Injector</a>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And <a href="Ambix_3rd_order.htm">here</a> you find a 
guide on how to prepare such a file containing panoramic video and third-order 
Ambix for Vive Cinema, Gopro VR Player or VLC Mediaplayer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The present guide, instead, is limited to First Order Ambisonics 
plus head-locked stereo, as currently supported by Youtube. And for this goal, 
the standard Metadata Injector v. 2.1 provided by Google is good enough, 
although, of course, you can also use my new High oder Metadata Injector. We also 
need two other free, multi-platform and open source programs, Audacity and 
FFMPEG, as explained here below.</font></p>
<hr>
<h1><font face="Arial">Preparing the 6-channels sound track using
<a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a></font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Most people traditionally prefer to edit separately the Ambisonics 
&quot;spatial audio&quot; soundtrack and the stereo head-locked soundtrack. Hence the 
results are typically two separate .WAV files, one is a 4-channels Ambix, the 
other is a plain 2-channels stereo. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">More recently, people started working at Third Order 
Ambisonics, hence the Ambix soundtrack will have 16 channels, not just 4. In 
tjis case, you firs need to convert Third ORder to First order, which is done 
esaily just jkeeping the first 4 chanenls of the 16-chanenls third order WAV 
file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">There are many ways of performing this. One is using the 
FB360 Encoder free program (it is part of the
<a href="https://facebook360.fb.com/spatial-workstation/">FB Spatial Workstation</a>). 
It has the option of converting an input 3rd order Ambix (16ch) to an outpout 
1st order Ambix (4ch), as shown here:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="FB360_encoder.png" width="362" height="838"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The other simple way is to import your 16-channels WAV 
file in Audacity, which will split it in 16 mono tracks. Then you simply close 
tracks 5..16, and you end up with just the first 4 channels. At this point you 
can export them as a single 4-channels WAV file, or, better, you directly pack 
these 4 channels with the additional 2 channels of HL stereo, as explained here 
below.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Let's assume that they are named 
Ambix-01.wav and Stereo-01.wav. And of course there is also a video-only file, 
typically saved as an .mp4 file containing a video stream compressed with H264 
or H265 codec.<br>
So a typical folder containing the streams to be assembled is as follows:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="files.png" width="1268" height="325"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is not possible to assembly directly the two audio 
files together with the video file: first it is required to &quot;pack together&quot; the 
two audio files, inside a single 6-channels .WAV file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is done easily employing the free, open source 
program <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>. There is&nbsp; 
just one simple trick: after installing Audacity, it is necessary to remove one 
default setting, which causes to &quot;downmix&quot; everything to a single stereo output 
file, forcing the program to save instead a true multichannel file.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is done opening the preferences of Audacity, and 
selecting the option labelled &quot;Use custom mix (..)&quot;</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-preferences.png" width="574" height="332"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After setting up Audacity as shown here, the task is 
trivial: just IMPORT in Audacity your two WAV files (using File - Import - 
Audio) as shown here:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Import.png" width="926" height="708"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Select the TWO wav files:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Import-2.png" width="557" height="417"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And here is what you get:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-tracks.png" width="926" height="707"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It can be seen how the 4-channels Ambix file was split 
into 4 mono tracks (as Audacity is yet uncapable of keeping more than two 
channels inside the same track), whilst the following 2-channels headlocked file 
was opened as a single stereo track.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In case the Ambix track was 16-channels (3rd order) 
instead of 4-channels (1st order), after importing you see the following:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-16+2.png" width="800" height="668"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">You can now simply remove, by clicking on the &quot;X&quot; on the 
left, all channels ranging from 5 to 16, leaving the first 4, and the last two 
(HL stereo). So you are back at the same situation as in the previous picture.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now it is possibly the moment where the relative gains of 
the two &quot;ingredients&quot; are adjusted. In fact, typically the stereo track is too 
loud, and the Ambix soundtrack is too weak for being played simultaneously.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The head-locked sound should be very gentle, for avoiding 
to disrupt the capability of the Ambix soundtrack of giving the listener the 
impression of &quot;being there&quot; inside the spatial environment shown in the video.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But of course this is left to the taste of the sound 
designer...</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">In this example, it resulted advisable to reduce the gain 
of the Stereo Head-locked track by 10 dB. So I selected just the stereo track, 
and applied gain reduction using the command Effect - Amplify...:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Amplify.png" width="299" height="220"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Remember that during playback these 6 channels will be 
downmixed to 2 and filtered with HRTF filters, hence the maximum level will peak 
much louder than the signal on any of the 6 channels. Hence it is absolutely to 
be avoided to &quot;maximize the gain&quot;, as it is usually done when creating standard 
soundtracks in which each channel will be simply played by the corresponding 
loudspeaker. The Youtube Spatial Audio medium is significantly more critical 
than other media regarding the risk of clipping and distortion during playback, 
so we must be very conservative. My recommendation is to avoid any peak louder 
than -6 dB full scale, and possibly staying under -10 dB FS, as I did in this 
example. So these are the 6 channels after gain optimization:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-optimized.png" width="926" height="707"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We can now export the 6 channels into a single WAV file, 
using the command File - Export:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Export.png" width="557" height="417"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It can be seen how, for preserving the maximum sound 
quality, the output format was set to &quot;Other uncompressed files&quot;. Under 
&quot;Options&quot;, the following has been specified:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Uncompressed.png" width="326" height="184"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After clicking on the &quot;save&quot; button, the following picture 
is displayed, confirming that the 6 channels are being packed properly into the 
6-channels output file:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Audacity-Mixing.png" width="626" height="473"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And pressing finally on the &quot;OK&quot; button, the 6-channels 
WAV file named Ambix+Stereo-01.wav is created:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="files-2.png" width="1268" height="325"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We are able now to pack together (&quot;mux&quot;) the new 
6-chanenls audio file together with the video file.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><font face="Arial">Muxing audio with video employing
<a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a></font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">Although the operation of merging the 6-channels audio 
track with the video track can be done employing almost any existing video 
editor (for example Adobe Premiere), in this guide we favour open-source 
software. Which, indeed, provides much better control on what is done, and 
avoids to decompress and recompress again the video stream (causing significant 
loss of quality).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">FFMPEG</a> is perfect for 
this, as it allows to mux the two streams without applying any modification to 
them.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After installing FFMPEG and having it being properly 
inserted in the PATH of your computer, so you can launch it form any folder, you 
simply open a console window, navigate to the folder containing your audio and 
video files, and type the following command:</font></p>
<table border="1" width="100%" bordercolorlight="#000000" bordercolordark="#000000">
	<tr>
		<td bgcolor="#000000">
		<p style="margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 6px"><b>
		<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Courier New">&nbsp;ffmpeg -i Video-01.mp4 -i 
		&quot;Ambix+Stereo-01.wav&quot; -map 0:v -map 1:a -c:v copy -c:a copy 
		Output-01.mov</font></b></td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p><font face="Arial">In just a few milliseconds FFMPEG will write the new muxed 
Audio + Video file inside your folder, as shown here:</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="files-3.png" width="1268" height="351"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">But this new video file IS NOT READY for Youtube yet, as 
it has to be properly &quot;injected&quot; with the required metadata, so that Youtube 
will &quot;understand&quot; that the 6-channels audio track is NOT a 5.1 old-style 
&quot;surround&quot; soundtrack, and is instead the new Ambix+HL format.</font></p>
<hr>
<h1><font face="Arial">Injecting metadata into the audio+video file</font></h1>
<p><font face="Arial">The .mov file needs now to be injected with proper 
metadata. This is done using the Google Metadata Injector v. 2.1 (do not use 
previous versions, as they do not support the new Ambix+HL 6-channels format).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The Metadata Injector is a Python 2.7 script. This means 
that, for using it, you need first to install properly
<a href="https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/">Python 2.7</a> (not 
Python 3.xx).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Then download from the GITHUB repository the ZIP file 
containg the proper version of the
<a href="https://github.com/google/spatial-media/releases">Metadata Injector</a> 
for your operating system (WIndows or Mac). Unzip it to a folder, navigate to 
the subfolder named </font>
<span style="color: rgb(36, 41, 46); font-family: Arial; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
&quot;spatialmedia&quot; and double click on the &quot;gui.py&quot; script. This will launch Python 
and display the following window, where you can open your MOV file and specify 
the metadata to be injected, as shown here:</span></p>
<p><img border="0" src="Injector.png" width="362" height="275"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">At this point, clicking on the &quot;inject metadata&quot;&nbsp; 
button a new version of the mov file is created, with &quot;_injected&quot; added to its 
name. </font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="files-4.png" width="1268" height="375"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">THIS IS THE GOOD FILE to be upoaded on Youtube!</font></p>
