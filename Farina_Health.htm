Farina</a>&nbsp; </font></h3>

<hr>

<p><font size="5">This page has been created for informing students, industrial 
sponsors, friends and scientific partners about the recent health problems 
occurred to Angelo during summer 2007, and about the consequences deriving from 
it about academic, research and consultancy activities.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">The problems derived from a long flight back from Australia to 
Italy (3 consequent flights of 8h each, on 22-23 July 2007), which caused a 
thrombosis at the right leg. After arriving in Italy, Angelo did not understand 
immediately what was happened. Thanks to some Aspirins, the pain at the leg 
disappeared in a couple of days, and Angelo restarted his intense activity as 
normal. But after some days (exactly on Saturday 29 July) he experienced severe 
respiratory pain, probably due to a lung emboly, caused by some part of 
thrombotical material flowing in the blood. </font></p>
<p><font size="5">Angelo went to the Hospital, where the problem was initially 
underestimated (you can see the report and the lung X-ray images
<a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/RX">here</a>). However, he was also 
invited to perform more extensive medical investigation on next Monday. These 
investigations did include an Echo-Doppler at the right leg. which confirmed the 
Thrombosis, and a lung TAC, which luckily excluded an Emboly: in fact, the 
respiratory pain had suddenly disappeared the evening before, probably because 
the small obstruction did pass through.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">After these examinations, Angelo Was hospitalized for one 
week, and subjected to Anticoagulant Treatment, both by under-skin injections of 
Eparin and by oral treatment (which takes longer to reach the wanted effect, but 
which can be protracted for months or years).</font></p>
<p><font size="5">After one week, being the life-risk almost completely removed, 
Angelo was sent home, but still under the double Anti Coagulant treatment. Only 
after two further weeks the oral treatment reached the required anticoagulant 
effect, so it was possible to end the Eparin treatment.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Angelo was commanded a two-months leave from his academic 
duties, which ended on 24 September 2007. During this period, 
he was not allowed to drive cars or motorcycles, to stay in the same position for 
long times, and he had to walk often, in plain, always wearing the special sock 
for avoiding other thrombosis at the right leg.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Initally the blood test was performed in a special 
Anticoagulation Lab evry 2-3 days, then every week, and now every two weeks. The 
test determines the Anticoagulation factor reached (named INR, and with therapeutic range set to 2.0 - 3.0). The history of these blood 
tests and an Excel chart showing the progress towards the therapeutic range are 
visible <a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/TAO">here</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">The medical tests performed in September (also visible <a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/TAO">here</a>) 
did show other problems at liver (steathosis) and at kidneys (gravel). This will 
require a strict diet for at least one year and further tests during Autumn 
2007.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">The medical staff did inform Angelo that he will have to 
continue the Anticoagulant Treatment for several months (exactly until 30 
january 2008), and to wear the special 
sock for at least 2 years, probably until the end of 2009. </font></p>
<p><font size="5">During the first period (24/09/2007 - 30/01/2008), 
after restarting service at the University, Angelo has to conform to 
strict regulations about the maximum time allowed to drive a vehicle (45 
minutes), the maximum time allowed to stand at the dashboard for lessons (45 
minutes, and no more than two lessons consecutively), and the maximum time 
allowed in front of a computer terminal (again 45 minutes, with a 15 minutes 
walk before being able to continue). Furthermore, in this period, he will have to take 
special precautions when flying (business class with feet support, Eparin 
injection, etc.). Flying is definitely not recommended in this period....</font></p>
<p><font size="5">This means that Angelo had to reschedule completely his 
academic and professional activity. In Academic Year 2007/2008 he will not hold 
any additional course, above the two standard ones at the Engineering Faculty. 
He will not be available for professional work, such as consultancy, 
measurements and industry-related research projects. He will not be able to 
travel a lot, certainly not as he was used to.</font></p>
<p><font size="5">Finally, he will not be able anymore to stay hours in front of 
his computer, answering to E-mails, developing software, web pages, etc. </font></p>
<p><font size="5">Angelo 
unsubscribed from all the Mail Lists to which he was used to contribute, such as Sursound or Music-DSP. </font></p>
<p><font size="5">His standard E-mail address (<a href="mailto:farina@unipr.it">farina@unipr.it</a>) 
has been left unattended for 2 months, and now is checked only very seldom, so 
do not expect immediate replies, as it was before....</font></p>
<p><font size="5">This page is here for informing everyone about this situation, 
for avoiding a congestion of requests of information, and for 
shielding Angelo from too much request of activity, while he now needs to stay 
calm and free of troubles for several months. It is suggested to everyone reading 
this page to avoid trying to contact Angelo during this healing period...</font></p>

<a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Grazia">Grazia Buia</a>, wife of Angelo, on 
24 August 2007, and modified on 28 September 2007. It will be update more or 
less monthly.....</font></p>
