	year = {2010},
	publisher = {Springer},
	booktitle = {Proceedings of Second International Conference "The Effect of Noise on Aquatic Life" Cork, Ireland, August 15-20 2010},
	abstract = {The underwater acoustic background noise, and the noise produced by a small outboard-engine boat moving at 6 knots, were recorded in the core zone WWF-Natural Marine Reserve of Miramare waters (Trieste, Italy), an area in which fish density is high, by using a tetrahedron-shaped 4-channels hydrophonic probe placed on the sea bottom. 
For the first time, a new 4-channels recording system was employed (“Soundfish”), capable of storing on an SD card, in standard WAV format, the signals coming from the 4 hydrophones. 
The collected data have been analyzed by means of the Brahmavolver software, a modification of the software initially developed for Brahma, a 4-channels recorder system developed for aerial applications. As result, vectorial decomposition of the sound field was obtained, containing a set of 4 signals, corresponding the 0th and 1st order spherical harmonics of the sound pressure field. In practice, the 0th-order components is the sound pressure, and the three first-order components are the three Cartesian components of the particle velocity.
Hence, the instantaneous Sound Intensity vector can be computed, from which the three-dimensional direction-of-arrival of the sound can be obtained, and the position of the predominant noise source can be tracked continuously.
A graphical tool such as Surfer ™, was used for charting the vectorial information over a marine map of the area, evidencing the estimated position of the sound source at every instant. This allowed for the construction of the trajectory of a moving sound source, such as a boat. This data can be employed for an analysis of the cause-effect relationship, as at every instant the position of the source, relative to the receiver, is known. 
The paper provides a detailed description of the Soundfish recorder, presents the result of a preliminary test of its angular accuracy obtained by experiments conducted inside a large test pool on a automated turntable, explains the mathematical and physical details of the signal processing performed by Brahmavolver, and presents the analysis of the recordings collected at the Miramare Reserve, showing the estimated iso-level contour maps of the boat passages, and, for the first time,  statistics about the spatial properties of the sea background noise.
It is also planned to employ the multichannel recordings for making in-air or in-pool playback of the recorded sound, employing a 3D surround loudspeaker system (working following the principle of th Ambisonics method), in order to reproduce the underwater acoustical spatial soundscape recorded in the field, something actually impossible to obtain from mono recordings containing just the sound  pressure information.}

A comparison between the vibration modes obtained from theory and experimental data allows us to estimate the constitutive parameters of these new disks. In addition, our study includes a numerical analysis that takes into account the effects of the disk rotation. Theoretical modes show good agreement with experimental data. They both confirm a reduction in the high frequency modes exhibited by the damped disk when compared to the undamped disk.
The finite element analysis allows prediction for the shift in natural frequencies produced by the centrifugal force field acting on the disk surface.},

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the results of the ESPRIT project APLODSP. The goal of this application experiment is to develop adequate models for the simulation of the non-linear behavior of loudspeakers and to design a dedicated audio processor to reduce sound distortion. This involves the definition of a systematic design flow for anti-distortion audio processors, and the effective exploitment of CAD tools for the automatic implementation of the defined algorithms. The audio processor will be implemented with a DSP, using state-of-the-art tools for simulation, validation and synthesis. DSP is the emerging low cost technology for audio processing, and in particular for car-audio systems. In fact, car manufacturers are planning to reduce the cables inside the car and to use a single cable to distribute the main signals multiplexed all around the vehicle. This transition to digital audio signal transmission will foster the use of active loudspeakers, equipped with dedicated digital audio processors. The audio processor, designed and tested within this ESPRIT project, can be seen as a first step in this direction. It shows how the loudspeaker distortion can be reduced by digital signal processing, and it exploits the versatility of digital designs in order to allow hardware re-use for different car models. It also allows a very fast redesign to fit many different purposes.
A semi-automatic design flow for the design of anti-distortion audio processors is available, which synthesizes a dedicated audio processor for each loudspeaker model, once suitable loudspeaker parameters have been specified.},

Measurements of the axial acceleration have been performed in hundreds of points on
the surface of the cone, employing a Laser Doppler Vibrometer and using the
exponential sine sweep excitation signal. The recorded signal has been transformed
into an impulse response by convolution with the matched inverse sweep signal. From
the knowledge of the acceleration in each point of the radiating surface, the free field
sound pressure in axis at 1m distance has been computed.
The research focuses on obtaining results comparable to FEM simulations, based only
on the linear mechanical behaviour of the loudspeaker cone and avoiding any acoustic
interference. Moreover, comparing the laser measurements of many samples, the
authors seek to evaluate the influence of known variations in the loudspeaker
components or production process on the final performances of the device. Post-
processing of experimental results is carried out employing a Matlab script, which
computes also operational deflection shapes of the loudspeaker cone.},

The measurement system is based on the use of two head and torso simulators, one equipped with an artificial mouth, the second equipped with binaural microphones.

The authors developed a new measurement system, which captures 32-channels impulse responses by means of a
spherical microphone array and a matrix of FIR filters, capable of proving frequency-independent directivity
patterns. This allows for spatial analysis with resolution much higher than what was possible with obsolete sumand-
delay beamforming.
The software developed for this application creates a false-colour video of the spatial distribution of energy,
changing with running time along the impulse response duration. A virtual microphone probe allows to extract the
sound coming from any specific direction. The method was successfully employed in three concert halls, providing
guidance for correcting some acoustical problems (echo, focusing) and for placing sound reinforcement
loudspeakers in optimal positions.}

At the end of the exposition path, a special HOA space is employed for showing the recent
developments of recording/reproduction methods started from the Ambisonics concept,
capable of creating natural reproduction of sport events, live music and other immersive
acoustical experiences; in this room also a binaural/transaural system is available.
A second, larger listening room capable of 30seats is equipped with a horizontal WFS array
covering the complete perimeter of the room. The paper describes the technology employed,
the problems encountered due to the difficult acoustical conditions (the museum was formerly
a church), and the novel software tools developed for the purpose on LINUX platforms.},

Coupled with the already established method based on Exponential Sine Sweep, this new Silence Sweep method provides a quick and complete characterization of not linear distortions and noise of the device under test.
The method is based on the analysis of the distortion products, such as harmonic distortion products or intermodulation effects, occurring when the system is fed with a wide-band signal. Removing from the test signal a small portion of the whole spectrum, it becomes possible to collect and analyze the not-linear response and the noise of the system in that “suppressed” band. Changing continuously the suppressed band over time, we get the Silence Sweep test signal, which allows for quick measurement of noise and distortion over the whole spectrum.
The paper explains the method with a number of examples. The results obtained for some typical devices are presented, compared with those obtained with a standard, state-of-the-art measurement system.},

	abstract = {The definition and measurement of sound spatialisation have been strongly enhanced in last years, as nowadays spatial properties of sound propagation are considered quite important during design of auditoria. Besides, a proper description of spatiality is requested during virtual audio reproduction of sound quality in dedicated listening rooms for 3D reproduction purposes. Normally, only binaural measurements are performed, by means of a dummy head, even though international standards like ISO 3382 require measuring some spatial parameters (i.e. LE, LF, IACC). 3D impulse responses are rarely measured and utilised for sound reproduction. In this paper, an innovative procedure of measuring spatial sound characteristics is presented. The application of this new technique in virtual 3D sound reconstruction is emphasized. Furthermore, the methodology is
compared with other techniques of 3D sound reproduction. Finally, the results of a wide campaign of measurements of spatial parameters among different auditoria all over the world, and conducted with the novel methodology, are compared with the results of standard binaural and 3D measurements. The possibility to enhance the spatial reproduction of sound quality in real spaces and the comprehensibility of spatial parameters is then considered and presented in different cases.},

and insulation index for airborne sound insulation. They can be measured following the method described in
CEN/TS 1793-5 standard, based on impulse response measurements employing a pressure microphone. The method
mandates for averaging results of measurements taken in different points in front of the device under test and/or for
specific angles of incidence, employing the obsolete MLS signal for performing the measurements, which can cause
severe artefacts due to nonlinearity and time-variance of the system. Furthermore, the CEN/TS 1793-5 standard presents
some geometric problems, which could arise if the barrier does not reach a minimum height or if it has a very
rough (scattering) surface. During the reflection index measurement on a barrier of limited height, the reflected sound
can be contaminated by the ground reflection, compromising the fairness of the whole result. Also the insulation index
can be affected by the height of the noise barrier, since the sound passing above the device under test can become
mixed with the sound passing through it. It has been noticed how these practical problems, jointly with the assumption
of a surface reflecting specularly in the final formula, can significantly over/under estimate the laboratory values
of both the indices. Results of in situ tests based on CEN/TS 1793-5 will be shown in comparison with results obtained
through a different approach, based on sound intensity measurements, and with the traditional tests performed
in the lab.}

	abstract = {The short-term behavioural effects of two types of boat noise were tested on Gobius cruentatus and Chromis chromis, i.e. one permanently and one temporarily benthic vocal fish species living inside the WWF-Natural Miramare Marine Reserve (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). The underwater noises produced by a 26-m tourist ferry and a 5-m fiberglass boat were recorded inside the core zone of the reserve. Each type of boat noise was subsequently played back in situ to 10 animals per species (C. chromis males caring their nests or G. cruentatus in their shelters).

The 1/3 octave spectra of recorded sound pressure levels were compared to the underwater ambient noise level and to sound pressure level measured at the hearing threshold of the two species. The boat noise levels have been calculated in terms of particle acceleration for both field measurements and in situ playback projections and subsequently compared to the available measured values of particle acceleration at the hearing threshold.

The animals were free to move in all directions during the whole experimental session. The behaviour of each fish was videotaped by an underwater camera for a total of 10 min (5 min before and 5 min during the noise playback). No short-term behavioural reaction (aversion) was observed in any of the specimen of the two species during the playback of the recorded noises, therefore suggesting no impact. However a time-budget analysis revealed a significant change in the total time spent in caring their nests (C. chromis) or inside their shelters (G. cruentatus). This result highlighted how analyzing fish reaction on a short-term might underestimate the effects of noise disturbance and indicated that the overall fish behaviour should be considered to assess noise impact.},

	abstract = {A growing body of scientific evidence shows that the increasing noise pollution in coastal environments due to human activities has detrimental effects on marine animals, including many endangered species. As a consequence, research studies and subsequent conservational actions are needed to mitigate the effects of noise pollution. One important step is to safeguard sensitive areas known as marine protected areas (MPAs) from anthropogenic noise; these ecologically rich areas, critical habitats for key species, are often located in highly populated coastal zones. This is the case of the WWF-Miramare Natural Marine Reserve, a UNESCO-Man and Biosphere Programme (MAB) Biosphere Reserve located in the Gulf of Trieste (Italy) and considered an important seasonal nursery area in the North Adriatic Sea (Guidetti et al. 2005). Although a recent study (Codarin et al. 2008), based on daytime acoustic monitoring, shows that the Miramare fish population is living in a heavily noisy underwater environment year-round, relatively little is known about the features and anthropogenic factors of nocturnal sea ambient noise (SAN) in the Reserve. This information is particularly relevant considering that intraspecific communication of many marine species (i.e., the brown meager, Sciaena umbra, during spawning season; Bonacito et al. 2001) occurs after sunset and during night. As a consequence, the present study aims 1) to quantify the nocturnal ambient noise levels at the Reserve, 2) to distinguish and quantify the biological versus anthropogenic components of the noise, and 3) to discuss their possible interaction.},

	volume = {99},
	abstract = {The analysis of the sound field’s 3D properties has been strongly improved in recent years, after spatial properties
of sound propagation have been acknowledged to be important during the design or correction of theatres
and auditoria. Besides, a proper assessment of spatial accuracy is requested for 3D sound reproduction systems,
initially designed for acoustical virtual reality and now also employed in the entertainment/cinema industry
(Immsound, Auro-3D, NHK 22.2). Often only monoaural or binaural measurements are performed by means
of omni-directional microphones and dummy heads, although international standards like ISO 3382/1:2009 also
define some “truly spatial” parameters such as JLF and JLFC. The two latter parameters are derived from measurements
made with a pressure velocity (p/v) microphone, but this is still a 2-channel measurement. 3D Impulse
Responses (4-channel B-format) have for many years been measured and employed for sound reproduction.
Recently, higher-order 3D Impulse Responses have been measurable thanks to the availability of compact microphone
arrays employing a much larger number of transducers. In this paper, two procedures for measuring and
analysing the complete spatial sound information are presented, which are aimed at creating easy-to-understand
images and videos showing the direction-of-arrival of the room reflections. The description of these techniques
is emphasised. Furthermore, results are illustrated of experiments conducted with the novel methodologies in
different rooms, including some ancient theatres.},

	address = {New York},
	booktitle = {Proceedings of 55th AES Conference},
	abstract = {Multichannel recordings are usually performed by means of microphone arrays. In many cases "sparse" and discrete microphone arrays are used, where each microphone is employed for capturing one of the channels, which in turn is routed to one loudspeaker. 
However, also the usage of "dense" microphone arrays has a long history, dating back to the first MS-matrixed microphones setups and passing through the whole Ambisonics saga.
A dense microphone array is employed differently from a sparse array: each channel is obtained by a combination of the signals coming from all the capsules, by means of different matrixing and filtering approaches. And similarly, each loudspeaker feed results from a re-matrixing of all the transmitted channels.
This paper is the third of a series: in the previous two [1,2] a numerical method for computing a matrix of FIR filter was employed for processing the microphone signals (encoding, [1]) and for computing the speaker feeds (decoding, [2]). In this third paper, the same numerical approach is extended to intermediate processing (rotation, zooming, stretching, spatial equalization, etc.): hence we have now a general meta-theory, providing a unique framework capable of processing the signals for any kind of dense microphone array, providing any kind of intermediate manipulation, and finally projecting the signal to every kind of loudspeaker arrays. The same framework can operate according to different standards and formats, including A-format (raw signals), B-format (High Order Ambisonics signals), G-format (speaker feeds) and P-format (Spatial PCM Sampling signals), and can be used for converting freely among them.
Experimental results are presented, including "traditional" tetrahedral probes, a commercial spherical microphone array, and two newly-developed massive microphone arrays developed by the authors, a cylindrical and a planar array, both incorporating 32 high-quality condenser microphones and a panoramic video camera.},

	abstract = {A new method for recording the spatial properties of a soundfield, or for generating a synthetic 
three-dimensional soundfield, is described. The spatial distribution of sound waves passing at a 
point in space is sampled by means of a number of virtual directive microphones, covering the 
surface of a sphere. This corresponds to a discretization of the spatial information, which is 
exactly the spatial equivalent of the PCM sampling of a waveform. 
The paper shows how it is possible to obtain information about the direction of early reflections 
in a theatre, not only by means of a 32-channels microphone, but also by means of traditional Bformat microphone (Soundfield). The method is applied to a historical Italian theatre, located in 
Bologna, i.e. the 1763 theatre in Villa Mazzacorati. 
The post processing includes the visualisation of the early reflections on a panoramic picture of 
the theatre, in which early reflections are reported as different circles on the figure, where the 
dimension and the intensity are related with the characteristics of the reflections. 
Moreover, the influence of the height of the microphone in the calculation of the acoustic 
parameters was analysed. The measurements were repeated at different height and different 
position on a transversal line in the theatre, and statistically analysed.},

Local newspapers wrote about the awakening of the ghosts of ancient Etruscans, a population that lived in this area in olden times.
In order to discover the source of such vibrations, the authorities of the village first called researchers of the National Institute of Geophysics who made measurements of vibration in different parts of the village and identified the waterfall of a weir, recently built to control the flow of the river Reno, as the source of the phenomena. The spectrum of the vibrations was characterized by a frequency of 8 Hz. The presence of such at distances of about 4 - respect to the valley floor, of the phenomena could be vibrations 5 Km and brought up by air as far in the well away from the weir, raised positions with idea that transmission as by ground. Local authorities decided to start new investigations and entrusted the work to the Institute of Technical Physics and the Institute of Hydraulics of the University of Bologna.

In this paper, authors describe the construction of a low-cost, ten-hydrophones, nonuniform linear array to be employed in passive and active sonar applications.
Many experiments were conducted, under controlled conditions (large pool), oriented to
characterize both individual transducers as well as the complete array. Using the array in “passive” mode, employing an omnidirectional sound source and a non-impulsive signal,
beamforming and inverse filtering techniques, the authors evaluated array directivity over a wide range of frequencies (1-23 kHz) and also its capability to estimate the direction of
arrival (DOA).
Furthermore, this work also focuses on searching objects and identification. Different test were performed, in order to estimate system performances when used as the receiver of an
active sonar. Using sine-sweep signals, and a specific real-time software developed by the authors, several measures were conducted in the shallow and very shallow water showing
the ability of the system to detect objects in a 45° wide angle.},

emitted from an omnidirectional source located on the stage, it has been possible to determine octaveband values of reverberation time, early decay time, clarity, center time, strength, and parameters related 
to spaciousness and envelopment, such as IACC and LF. The experimental findings suggest that,

Recentemente è stata 
emanato un decreto che 
stabilisce limiti precisi ai

sul luogo di lavoro (DLGS 187 
del 19/98/2005), mentre non 
esiste ancora alcuna

	abstract = {Techniques based on impulsive sources are used since the beginning of the Underwater Acoustic science, to evaluate the distance of objects and to plot the profile of the sea bottom. In this paper the authors investigate the behavior of three not-impulsive
techniques for the measurement of impulse responses: MLS (Maximum Length Sequence) signal, linear sine sweep and logarithmic sine sweep.
This work will focus the attention on advantages and defects of these tree different methods,
in comparison with the traditional pulse-based sonar techniques.
The mathematical theory for the generation of the MLS, sine sweep signals and for the deconvolution of the system’s impulse response are first described. Then a software implementation of the measurement methods, based on the creation of plug-ins for a shareware waveform editor, running on a low cost PC is demonstrated.
Some experiments conducted under controlled conditions and in the sea show that the proposed techniques produce images of the bottom profile with higher signal-to-noise ratio and better spatial resolution than those obtainable with the impulsive technique. Moreover signal-to-noise ratio increases using sine sweep signal instead of MLS one.
The new techniques seem superior also for some practical aspects connected with their very nature, which make them almost inaudible and makes the sound source barely localizable: this is very important for military applications.},
