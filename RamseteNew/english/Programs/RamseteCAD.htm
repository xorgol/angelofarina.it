<p>This program is a real 3D CAD system that can import and export DXF files generated 
by AutoCAD.  You can work on many views at the same time: plant, sections and axonometry.  
This is an example of a typical Ramsete CAD screen</p>

floor, wall, roof, door, window.  The current cursor position is always displayed 
in the status bar</p>
