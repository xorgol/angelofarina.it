<H3>You can download the Latest Ramsete Software:<BR>Ramsete 1.7/2.0 
 Release Candidate 4<BR>(9 October 2001)</H3>


<P><FONT size=4>Following these instructions, you can download the 
latest release of the Ramsete package.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>For installing the software, You need to obtain the 
proper password from the author</FONT></P>

<P><FONT size=4>Please note: Ramsete is NOT freeware! You need to 
purchase the hardware protection key (dongle) for making the program to work. 
So, if You do not have the dongle, please do not bother us (the authors) 
requesting the password for installing the software, because even with the 
password, but without the dongle, the program will not run (until when You are 
able of cracking it!).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=4>Please, contact the publisher (<A 
href="http://www.spectra.it/">Spectra</A>) for prices and other commercial info. 
In some cases, they will supply a dongle for a limited evaluation period. 
Remember that THEY ARE THE PUBLISHER, we (the authors) are not responsible of 
the commercial stuff.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT size=3>Upgrading from Ramsete 1.70 to Ramsete 2.00</FONT></B></P>
<P>The only action required is to substitute the old hardware protection dongle 
(black) with the new one (white). Each module will recognize the new dongle, and 
make it available the new functions. Please, look at the <A 
href="../news.htm">Ramsete II news page</A> for an 
overview of the new functions.</P>

<P>Now Audio Converter is included within the setup of Ramsete 1.70. You do not 
need anymore to download it separately. If You do not have a Convolver for 
employing the impulse responses during the auralization process, please have a 
look at the <A href="http://www.ramsete.com/Ramsete/convolution.htm">Convolution 
Home Page</A>. Now a small, very simple real-time convolver is included in the 
Ramsete package.</P>
