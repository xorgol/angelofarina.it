<h4><font size="1">Subdivision Level</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This parameter controls the number of pyramids in wich will be subdivided the balloon of each 
noise/sound source in the geomtric model (.ray).  The minimum level is 0 and it corresponds to 8 pyramids only.
For each level increment the number of pyramids will be doubled, so the following formula holds true:
<br><i><b>Pyramids = 8*2^Level</b></i><br>
Increasing the subdivision level, your results will be more precise, but keep in mind that 
the computation time needed will increase exponentially.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Time</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This is the number of seconds for which the path of the pyramids will be followed. 
This parameter, together with the time resolution, influences the size of the impulse response buffer, 
hence the amount of RAM used by the program (see below) and the size of the resulting files (.__a, .__b, ...).</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Time resolution</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This parameter specifies the size of each time slot (i.e. the resolution) of the computed impulse response.
The resolution needed is tightly tied with the specific quantities you want to visualize with Ramsete View,
so it can be as small as 0.0001 seconds, or as big as the Time parameter. Each time slot will eat 40 bytes of RAM,
so if you want to estimate the RAM needed by the computation, you can use this formula:
<br><i><b>Bytes = 40 * (Time / Resolution + 1) * Receivers</b></i><br>
</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Humidy</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This is the percentage of humidity of the simulated room, so it can range from 5% to 100%.
If you don't know the actual value of th humidity, you can safely assume it's 50%.
The humidiy affects the attenuation of the acoustic signal propagating in the air.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Temperature</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
The temperature of the air inside the model is expressed in Celsius degrees, so it can assume negative values too.
This parameters affects the speed of the sound in the air.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Diffraction level</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
When a spherical sound wave hits a wall with one or more free edges, it can reach the 
receivers behind it, even if the line connecting them to the image source is obstructed 
by the wall itself.  The normal tracing algorithms don't handle this particular configuration,
so they simply ignore the receivers behind the wall and reflect the wave as usual.
The full simulation of this physical behaviour would be very time consuming, but we
can reach a compromise between computation time and simulation precision by limiting the number of diffractions 
to one or two consecutive faces.  In the worst case, i.e. two faces with four free edges 
(two consecutive panels suspended in the air), you can have 16 energy contributions from a single wave.
You should check this option on only when your model contains a limited number of 
obstructing faces with significant dimensions.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">History</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Normally the path of a pyramid is followed for the specified amount of time, 
but sometimes it can be useful to stop the calculations after a fixed number of reflections
againsy the walls of the room.  Checking history checkbox you can fix the maximum number of reflections and force the program 
to ignore the time limit.  Anyway the time still determines the size of the impulse response buffers 
but doesn't affect the duration of the simulation.  You can specify any number greater than or equal to zero. 
Specifying a zero history, you force the computation of the direct wave only.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Randomize after</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
The simulation algorithm adopted by Ramsete always gives predictable and repetible results, 
for a given geometric configuration.  Anyway, expecially when studying simple geometries,
you could obtain some unexpected artifacts in the resulting impulse response, 
due to the unlucky relative positions of the sources and the walls.  
If after a specified number of reflections, you add a small random deviation to the pyramids, 
you could remove this artifacts, simulating also a sort of diffusion effect (see below).</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Save hits</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Ramsete View can visualize the path of the pyramids from the source to every single receiver.
In order to enable this useful option you have to select the maximum number of hits (reflections)
you want to store on a special file (.@__) associated with the usual impulse response file.
This file can easily reach huge dimensions, so you must keep this parameter as small as possible
and you should also check often the free space left on your hard disk.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Diffusion</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Ramsete 2 can also simulate the diffuse energy that normally is ignored by the standard algorithms.
Turning this option on gives you much more realistic results, cancelling the artifacts 
introduced by any deterministic simulation, expecially near the queue of the impulse response.  
Of course you have to pay the price of a longer computation time.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Save diffuse hits</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Checking this option you can save also the energy contributions due to diffusion effect
in the same file in which are stored the normal hits.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Save separated sources</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
When you check this option, the program will save a different result file for each source present in the model.
The file corresponding to the first source will be named after the model name but it will have a ".__a" extension.
The second file will have a ".__b" extension and so on ...  If you uncheck this option all the results will be 
summed in a single ".___" file.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Save escaped rays</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Sometimes you may notice that some pyramids can't hit a surface, so they "escape" from the modeled room.
This behavior is normal in open spaces, but should be avoided in closed ones.  Saving the escaped rays
in the special file "escaped.ray" and loading it in Ramsete CAD, you can have many hints on the 
unwanted holes present in your model.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">The following file has been already processed</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This box informs you that the file whose name apperas below the the checkbox itself, has already been processed,
thus it will be ignored if you press the "Start" button to begin the calculation.  If you want to force the 
recalculation of the results, simply uncheck this box.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">...</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
Pressing this button you can add files to the list of ".ray" models to be processed.
Once the list is complete you can click on the individual names and make modifications
to any of the parameters described above, so that each model can be processed differently with the 
appropriated options.  You can also remove one or more files from the list clicking the "Clear" button.</font>
</p>
<h4><font size="1">Save Default</font></h4><p>
<font size="1">
This button saves all the current settings to the <i>ramsete.ini</i> so that they can be retrieved on 
each execution of Ramsete, with no need of inserting them from scratch each time.</font>
