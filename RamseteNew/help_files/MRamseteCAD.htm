<hr>
<a name="New"><h3>File New</h3></a>
This command saves the current drawing (if any) and clears all active views allowing you to start a new project.
<a name="Open"><h3>File Open</h3></a>
This command displays the usual Windows file selection dialog box, in which you can select the name of the desired .RAY or <A href="#DxfIn">.DXF</a> file.
<a name="Merge"><h3>Merge</h3></a>
This command if analogous to the <A href="#open">File Open</a> option, the unique differece is the fact that the selected file is appended to the current model instead of replacing it.
<a name="Save"><h3>Save</h3></a>
This command saves the current drawing using the usual Windows dialog box in which you can choose the name of file, the first time you save it.
You can also choose to save the model in <A href="#DxfOut">DXF</a> format.
When you save large projects you'll be asked for checking the duplicates entities you could have created accidentally or imported from from less than perfect DXF files.
If the program finds such entities you can safely delete them.  You can perform this task manually using the <A href="SelectDuplicates">Select duplicates</a> command.
<a name="SaveAs"><h3>Save as</h3></a>
This command allows you to save the current model with a different name, using the usal Window dialog box.
You can also choose to save the model in DXF format: see the <A href="#open">File Open</a> option for the details.
<a name="BaseMap"><h3>Base map</h3></a>
This command reads a DXF file, containing the 2D representation of the base map of the model.
You can draw actual walls following the resulting gray lines on the background
<a name="DxfIn"><h3>Dxf in</h3></a>
This command allows you to import a DXF file.
You should be informed about the guidelines you should follow in order to attain the best results:
<dl>
<li>3DFACE entities will be recognized as walls, floors 
  or ceilings, according to their orientation. If a 3DFACE is containded in 
  another 3DFACE it will be considered as a door or a window. 
  
<li>POLYLINE entities will be converted in holes in the 
  nearest wall. 
  
<li>LINE entities (preferably in the RECEIVERS layer) 
  will be converted in receivers placed on the starting point and oriented in 
  the same direction of the segment. 
  
<li>ATTDEF entities (preferably in the SOURCES layer) will be converted in sources placed on the starting point and oriented in the same direction of the segment.</li>
</dl>
If you want to learn all the details about the DXF format accepted by Ramsete, you should simply use the <A href="#DxfOut">Dxf out</a> command and analize the output with a text editor.
<a name="DxfOut"><h3>Dxf out</h3></a>
This command exports the current drawing in DXF format.  You can modify the DXF file using any DXF enabled tool.
Of course you can also import it again in Ramsete CAD using the <A href="#DxfIn">Dxf in</a> command.
<a name="ProjectNotes"><h3>Project notes</h3></a>
Using this command you can write some text notes to be attached to the project
<a name="Exit"><h3>Exit</h3></a>
This command exits the program after asking you to save the current drawing.
<hr>
<a name="Cut"><h3>Cut</h3></a>
This command deletes the currently selected entities and copies them into the clipboard.
You can <A href="Paste">paste</a> them in another drawing if you start a second instance of Ramsete CAD.
<a name="Copy"><h3>Copy</h3></a>
This command copies all the selected entities into the clipboard.
You can <A href="#Paste">paste</a> them in another drawing if you start a second instance of Ramsete CAD.
<a name="Paste"><h3>Paste</h3></a>
If you saved something into the clipboard, using a <A href="#Cut">Cut</a> or <A href="#Copy">Copy</a> command,
you can paste those entities in the current drawing.
<a name="Duplicate"><h3>Duplicate</h3></a>
This command is totally equivalent to the <A href="#Copy">Copy</a> and <A href="#Paste">Paste</a> command sequence.
The final effect is the duplication of all the selected entities.  
At this point you should immediately <A href="#ToolMove">move</a> them in another location.
If you don't do that you would obtain an inconsistent model, that could give umpredictable results.
<a name="Delete"><h3>Delete</h3></a>
This command deletes definitively the currently selected entities.
You can retrieve them only using the <A href="#Undo"> command</a>.
<a name="Undo"><h3>Undo</h3></a>
You can use this command to cancel the effects of your last action.  
For example: if you deleted a wall by accident, Undo will make it to reappear .
You can undo the last ten actions (subject to change). 
If your system performs too badly, you can disable the Undo command in the Options menu.
<a name="Redo"><h3>Redo</h3></a>
This command nullifies the effects of the preceding <A href="#Undo">undo</a> command: 
i.e. it repeats the last action that you accidentally undone.
<a name="Resize"><h3>Resize</h3></a>
This command displays a dialog box by which you can specify a scaling factor that will affect all the selected entities.
<a name="Properties"><h3>Properties</h3></a>
This command displays a dialog box by which you can edit the properties of the select items
<a name="Geometry"><h3>Geometry</h3></a>
This command displays a dialog box that shows the geometric properties of the selected objects.
<hr>
<a name="SelectAllEntities"><h3>Select All Entities</h3></a>
This command selects all the model entities.
<a name="SelectMaterial"><h3>Select Material</h3></a>
This command selects all entities made of a particular material, chosen from the list of all availabe materials.
<a name="SelectObstructing"><h3>Select Obstructing</h3></a>
This command displays a dialog box by which you can select <A href="#Obstructing" >obstructing faces</a> in three modes:
<dl>
<li>Select all obstructing faces 
  
<li>Select faces that should be obstructing 
  
<li>Assign automatically the obstructing flag</li>
</dl>
The first option simply scans the model and selects all the faces that has been declared as obstructing.<br>
The second option tries to determine euristically which faces should be declared as obstructing<br>
The third option performs the same task of the second but automatically assigns the obstructing flag to the selected faces.
<a name="SelectMonopermeable"><h3>Select Monopermeable</h3></a>
This command selects all the surfaces that has been declared as monopermeable. 
Usually you should use this special faces in order to enclose noise sources. 
The tracer will follow the path of the sound waves that will trespass the monopermeable faces only on the very first impact.
On successive impacts they will be reflected as usual.
<a name="ToggleAllReceivers"><h3>Toggle all receivers</h3></a>
This commands selects or deselects all the receivers present in the model.
<a name="ToggleAllSources"><h3>Toggle all sources</h3></a>
This commands selects or deselects all the sources present in the model.
<a name="Advanced"><h3>Advanced</h3></a>
This command displays a list of all the materials used in the model.
If you click on a item of the list, all the corresponding entities will be colored.
<a name="SelectDuplicates"><h3>Select Duplicates</h3></a>
This command scans the entire model for duplicate entities, i.e. objects with the identical geometric position of others.
This objects can be source of umpredictable results and so you should try to eliminate them all. 
Each time you save a model, it will checked for duplicates anyway.
<a name="Unselect all"><h3>Unselect all</h3></a>
This commands unselects all the currently selected entities.
<hr>
<a name="Pick"><h3>Pick</h3></a>
This is the selection tool by which you can select or deselect the entities you click onto.
In order to select a face you must click nearby its edges, not inside it!
You can also select rectangular areas by dragging the mouse pointer and keeping the left button pressed, in this way all the
entites inside the rectangle will be selected.  You can use this tool in any <A href="#Views">view</a> of the model.
<a name="Lens"><h3>Lens</h3></a>
Using the lens tool you can zoom in any detail of the model in any view.  
If you click the left mouse button you'll zoom in the area surrounding the selected point.
If you click the right mouse button you'll return to the standard view of the entire model.
You can also zoom rectangular areas by dragging the mouse pointer and keeping the left button pressed
<a name="Move"><h3>Move</h3></a>
Once you have selected some enties you can use this command in order to specify an offset to be applied to them.
You should simply click on a chosen point and drag the mouse to another target point.  
When you'll release the mouse button, all selected entities will be move accordingly.
<a name="Mirror"><h3>Mirror</h3></a>
This command allows you to mirror all the selected entities with respect to a plane.
You specify this mirroring plane by defining a line: simply click on the starting point and then drag the mouse pointer on the final point.
Now you'll be asked for the deletion of the selected entities that will be mirrored anyway.
<a name="Rotate"><h3>Rotate</h3></a>
This command allows you to rotate all the selected entities around a specified axis. 
You should click on the center of the rotation an specify the desired angle in degrees.
<hr>
<a name="Floor"><h3>Floor</h3></a>
Usually this is the very first tool you should use in order to define the floor for the entire project.
Normally you'll draw a rectangle by simply dragging the mouse pointer on the <A href="#Views" >plan view</a>.
<a name="Roof"><h3>Roof</h3></a>
The procedure to draw a roof is very similar to the one used for the floor <A href="#Floor">Floor</a>, 
but when you've drawn the rectangle you'll be prompted for the elevations of three points, 
the fourth we'll be computed automatically.
<a name="Wall"><h3>Wall</h3></a>
In the plant view you can draw a wall as a segment, in the front or side views you'll draw 
a rectangle.  When you've placed the segment you'll be asked for the minimum and maximum 
elevation of the wall. In the side or front view you'll be prompted for the missing coordinate with the standard dialog box.
<a name="Box"><h3>Box</h3></a>
This tool allows the creation of closed boxes. You shoud click one time in the position of each vertex of the 
polygonal base.  Then, when you click again on the first vertex, you'll be asked for the height of the box
and you'll be able to specify if you want a floor and a roof on it.
<a name="Boxes"><h3>Boxes</h3></a>
If you want to draw a serie of connected boxes you have simply to click on the junction points.
As soon as you click on the starting point you will be prompted for the box parameters.
Then, while you click on the following points, the program will draw the boxes.
In order to terminate the procedure, you should click two times on the last point.
<a name="Cylinder"><h3>Cylinder</h3></a>
In order to draw a cylinder you have to define the circumference arc of its base clicking 
onto three points to define the arc itself limits.  If you want to draw a complete circle 
you should click onto two points defining the diameter and click on the first point again 
to finish.  At this point you'll have to insert the cylinder elevations in the dialog box.
<a name="Sphere"><h3>Sphere</h3></a>
The procedure that defines a spherical surface is identical to the one we have described 
for the <A href="#cylinder" >cylinder</a>. This tool can't draw a complete sphere but only a 
fraction of it, but you can draw a semi-sphere and use the <A href="#mirror" >mirror</a> tool 
in order to have the complete work done.
<a name="Pipe"><h3>Pipe</h3></a>
The procedure to draw pipelines is identical to the one described for <a href="#Boxes">boxes</a>.
You'll be asked for the radius of the pipe as soon as you click on the starting point.
<a name="Door"><h3>Door</h3></a>
When you want to draw a door you have to select the wall that it belongs to and click on 
the position in which you want to place it.  Now you have to specify the door dimensions 
in the dialog box.
<a name="Window"><h3>Window</h3></a>
The procedure that creates a window is identical to the one we have described for creating a <A href="#door" >door</a>.
The only difference is that you have to input also the elevation of the window.
<a name="Hole"><h3>Hole</h3></a>
This tool allows you to make holes into walls.  First of all you should select the wall 
you want to perforate, then you describe a closed polygon clicking on its vertices.  
The last point of the polygon should coincide with the first one.  
If you draw a polygon with three vertices only you'll be asked if you are trying 
to draw an arc: if you answer "No" a triangular hole will be drawn, 
otherwise the system it will pop up a dialog asking you the number of segments 
that approximate to the arc. The number of steps is automatically suggested by the program 
and you can increase it if you wish, but keep it as small as possible to reduce computation 
times.
<a name="Source"><h3>Source</h3></a>
You specify the position of a source drawing a segment from its real position to the point 
it's aimed at.  This is very important for the correct computation of the sound field of 
directive sources.  At this point you'll be asked for the elevation of the source and of 
its target point. The roll angle defines the rotation of the source axis with respect for 
the floor plane (xy plane). At last you've to define the full path of the source parameters 
file in the common open dialog.
If you keep the Shift key pressed while dragging the mouse pointer you'll define a rectangular
grid of sources.  You define the density of the grid in the dialog box,
that will pop up after you have released the mouse button.
<a name="Receiver"><h3>Receiver</h3></a>
A receiver represents a microphone, any measure equipment or a person.  The tracer results 
will always be relative to the receiver's position, they shouldn't be considered the mean 
value of the room, so you should use more than a receiver in order to analyze a room properly.
The more receiver you place the more precise results you get, but remember that the resulting 
file will be much larger and the computation times longer.
You can place a receiver with the same steps described for a source, but you'll be asked for 
the receiver elevation only because the target point is always at the same height.  
This piece of information is fundamental for the computation of LE parameter.
You can draw a grid of receivers following the same procedure used for <A href="#Sources" >sources</a>.
<hr>
<a name="Views"><h3>Plant, Front and Side views</h3></a>
These are the standard orthogonal views that can be shown or hidden by selecting the corresponding menu option.
You can also activate them by pressing "P", "F" and "S" respectively.
<hr>
<a name="ViewOptions"><h3>View</h3></a>
Thid command displays a dialog box in which you can select some parameters that will affect the rendering of some entities.
In particular you can show or hide all the receivers, the sources and their respective orientation vectors.
<hr>
<a name="Help"><h3>Help</h3></a>
This command displays this help page using your internet browser.
<a name="About"><h3>About</h3></a>
This command displays the usual info box about the release of the program.
<hr>
<a name="Technical"><h2>Technical issues</h2></a>
<a name="Obstructing"><h3>What are obstructing faces?</h3></a>
<P>In Ramsete we call a face obstructing when it can obstruct any sound wave from a source to a receiver.
Simplifying a lot, we can say that a face should be declared obstructing when it is located between a source and a receiver.
Usually convex rooms (for example rectangular rooms) have no obstructing faces, infact all sources and receivers can be connected
by imaginary lines that never intersect any wall, roof or floor.  On the contrary, non convex rooms have walls that can block some waves,
causing also diffraction phaenomena.  The typical example is the L shaped room, that has two obstructing walls.  
Even all internal walls, low walls and slabs should usually be decalred obstructing.
<h3>Why should I declare obstructing faces?</h3>The main 
task of the tracing program consists in following the path of the sound waves, 
bouncing inside the rooms. The time of this computation increases drastically 
with the number or faces of your model, but you can significantly speed up the 
computations if you declare in advance which are the possible obstructing faces. 
It's very important that you declare correctly all obstructing faces, because if 
you forget some of them, you'll have very strange result. You could also declare 
all the faces as obstructing: this way you should get correct results, but be 
prepared for much longer computation times.</P>
<a name="Monopermeable"><H3>What are monopermeable faces?</H3></a>
<P>We define a face as monopermeable when it can be trespassed only one by a 
sound wave. From that moment it begins to behave as usual, like all other 
ordinary faces. This property is very useful in modeling the casing of 
noise sources. If you don't declare these faces as monopermeable you will 
be able to study the behavior of the sound wave inside the machine. The 
receivers will be reached only by the attenuated pyramyds or the diffused 
ones.</P>
