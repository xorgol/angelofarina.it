  <div id="advert">
    <div class="feature">
      <p align="justify"><strong>File New</strong><br />
This command saves the current drawing (if any) and clears  all active views allowing you to start a new project.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>File Open</strong><br />
        This command displays the usual Windows file selection dialog box, in  which you can select the name of the desired .RAY or .DXF file.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Merge</strong><br />
        This command if analogous to the File Open option, the unique  difference is the fact that the selected file is appended to the  current model instead of replacing it.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save</strong><br />
        This command saves the current drawing using the usual Windows dialog  box in which you can choose the name of file, the first time you save  it. You can also choose to save the model in DXF format. When you save  large projects you'll be asked for checking the duplicates entities you  could have created accidentally or imported from less than perfect DXF  files. If the program finds such entities you can safely delete them.  You can perform this task manually using the Select duplicates command.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save as</strong><br />
        This command allows you to save the current model with a different  name, using the Window dialog box. You can also choose to save the  model in DXF format: see the File Open option for the details.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Base map</strong><br />
        This command reads a DXF file, containing the 2D representation of the  base map of the model. You can draw actual walls following the  resulting gray lines on the background<br />
        Dxf in<br />
        This command allows you to import a DXF file. You should be informed  about the guidelines you should follow in order to attain the best  results:</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;-  3DFACE entities will be recognized as walls, floors or ceilings,  according to their orientation. If a 3DFACE is included in another  3DFACE it will be considered as a door or a window.<br />
  &nbsp;- POLYLINE entities  will be converted in holes in the nearest wall.<br />
  &nbsp;- LINE entities (preferably in the RECEIVERS layer) will be converted  in receivers placed on the starting point and oriented in the same  direction of the segment.<br />
  &nbsp;- ATTDEF entities (preferably in the SOURCES layer) will be converted  in sources placed on the starting point and oriented in the same  direction of the segment.</p>
      <p align="justify">If  you want to learn all the details about the DXF format accepted by  Ramsete, you should simply use the Dxf out command and analize the  output with a text editor.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Dxf out</strong><br />
        This command exports the current drawing in DXF format. You can modify  the DXF file using any DXF enabled tool. Of course you can also import  it again in Ramsete CAD using the Dxf in command.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Project notes</strong><br />
        Using this command you can write some text notes to be  attached to the project</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Exit</strong><br />
        This command exits the program after asking you to save the  current drawing.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Cut</strong><br />
        This command deletes the currently selected entities and copies them  into the clipboard. You can paste them in another drawing if you start  a second instance of Ramsete CAD.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Copy</strong><br />
        This command copies all the selected entities into the clipboard. You  can paste them in another drawing if you start a second instance of  Ramsete CAD.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Paste</strong><br />
        If you saved something into the clipboard, using a Cut or Copy command,  you can paste those entities in the current drawing.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Duplicate</strong><br />
        This command is totally equivalent to the Copy and Paste command  sequence. The final effect is the duplication of all the selected  entities. At this point you should immediately move them in another  location. If you don't do that you would obtain an inconsistent model,  that could give unpredictable results.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Delete</strong><br />
        This command deletes definitively the currently selected  entities. You can retrieve them only using the command.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Undo</strong><br />
        You can use this command to cancel the effects of your last action. For  example: if you deleted a wall by accident, Undo will make it to  reappear . You can undo the last ten actions (subject to change). If  your system performs too badly, you can disable the Undo command in the  Options menu.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Redo</strong><br />
        This command nullifies the effects of the preceding undo command: i.e.  it repeats the last action that you accidentally undone.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Resize</strong><br />
        This command displays a dialog box by which you can specify a scaling  factor that will affect all the selected entities.<br />
  <strong>Properties</strong><br />
        This command displays a dialog box by which you can edit the  properties of the select items</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Geometry</strong><br />
        This command displays a dialog box that shows the geometric  properties of the selected objects.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Select All Entities</strong><br />
        This command selects all the model entities.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Select Material</strong><br />
        This command selects all entities made of a particular  material, chosen from the list of all availabe materials.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Select Obstructing</strong><br />
        This command displays a dialog box by which you can select  obstructing faces in three modes:</p>
      <p align="justify">&nbsp;- Select all  obstructing faces<br />
  &nbsp;- Select faces that  should be obstructing<br />
  &nbsp;- Assign  automatically the obstructing flag</p>
      <p align="justify">The first option simply scans the model and selects all the  faces that has been declared as obstructing.<br />
        The second option tries to determine euristically which  faces should be declared as obstructing<br />
        The third option performs the same task of the second but automatically  assigns the obstructing flag to the selected faces.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Select Monopermeable</strong><br />
        This command selects all the surfaces that has been declared as  monopermeable. Usually you should use this special faces in order to  enclose noise sources. The tracer will follow the path of the sound  waves that will trespass the monopermeable faces only on the very first  impact. On successive impacts they will be reflected as usual.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Toggle all receivers</strong><br />
        This commands selects or deselects all the receivers present  in the model.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Toggle all sources</strong><br />
        This commands selects or deselects all the sources present  in the model.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Advanced</strong><br />
        This command displays a list of all the materials used in the model. If  you click on a item of the list, all the corresponding entities will be  colored.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Select Duplicates</strong><br />
        This command scans the entire model for duplicate entities, i.e.  objects with the identical geometric position of others. This objects  can be source of unpredictable results and so you should try to  eliminate them all. Each time you save a model, it will checked for  duplicates anyway.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Unselect all</strong><br />
        This commands unselects all the currently selected entities.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Pick</strong><br />
        This is the selection tool by which you can select or deselect the  entities you click onto. In order to select a face you must click  nearby its edges, not inside it! You can also select rectangular areas  by dragging the mouse pointer and keeping the left button pressed, in  this way all the entities inside the rectangle will be selected. You  can use this tool in any view of the model.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Lens</strong><br />
        Using the lens tool you can zoom in any detail of the model in any  view. If you click the left mouse button you'll zoom in the area  surrounding the selected point. If you click the right mouse button  you'll return to the standard view of the entire model. You can also  zoom rectangular areas by dragging the mouse pointer and keeping the  left button pressed</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Move</strong><br />
        Once you have selected some entities you can use this command in order  to specify an offset to be applied to them. You should simply click on  a chosen point and drag the mouse to another target point. When you'll  release the mouse button, all selected entities will be move  accordingly.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Mirror</strong><br />
        This command allows you to mirror all the selected entities with  respect to a plane. You specify this mirroring plane by defining a  line: simply click on the starting point and then drag the mouse  pointer on the final point. Now you'll be asked for the deletion of the  selected entities that will be mirrored anyway.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Rotate</strong><br />
        This command allows you to rotate all the selected entities around a  specified axis. You should click on the center of the rotation an  specify the desired angle in degrees.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Floor</strong><br />
        Usually this is the very first tool you should use in order to define  the floor for the entire project. Normally you'll draw a rectangle by  simply dragging the mouse pointer on the plan view.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Roof</strong><br />
        The procedure to draw a roof is very similar to the one used for the  floor, but when you've drawn the rectangle you'll be prompted for the  elevations of three points, the fourth we'll be computed automatically.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Wall</strong><br />
        In the plant view you can draw a wall as a segment, in the front or  side views you'll draw a rectangle. When you've placed the segment  you'll be asked for the minimum and maximum elevation of the wall. In  the side or front view you'll be prompted for the missing coordinate  with the standard dialog box.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Box</strong><br />
        This tool allows the creation of closed boxes. You should click one  time in the position of each vertex of the polygonal base. Then, when  you click again on the first vertex, you'll be asked for the height of  the box and you'll be able to specify if you want a floor and a roof on  it.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Boxes</strong><br />
        If you want to draw a series of connected boxes you have simply to  click on the junction points. As soon as you click on the starting  point you will be prompted for the box parameters. Then, while you  click on the following points, the program will draw the boxes. In  order to terminate the procedure, you should click two times on the  last point.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Cylinder</strong><br />
        In order to draw a cylinder you have to define the circumference arc of  its base clicking onto three points to define the arc itself limits. If  you want to draw a complete circle you should click onto two points  defining the diameter and click on the first point again to finish. At  this point you'll have to insert the cylinder elevations in the dialog  box.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Sphere</strong><br />
        The procedure that defines a spherical surface is identical to the one  we have described for the cylinder. This tool can't draw a complete  sphere but only a fraction of it, but you can draw a semi-sphere and  use the mirror tool in order to have the complete work done.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Pipe</strong><br />
        The procedure to draw pipelines is identical to the one described for  boxes. You'll be asked for the radius of the pipe as soon as you click  on the starting point.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Door</strong><br />
        When you want to draw a door you have to select the wall that it  belongs to and click on the position in which you want to place it. Now  you have to specify the door dimensions in the dialog box.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Window</strong><br />
        The procedure that creates a window is identical to the one we have  described for creating a door. The only difference is that you have to  input also the elevation of the window.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Hole</strong><br />
        This tool allows you to make holes into walls. First of all you should  select the wall you want to perforate, then you describe a closed  polygon clicking on its vertices. The last point of the polygon should  coincide with the first one. If you draw a polygon with three vertices  only you'll be asked if you are trying to draw an arc: if you answer  &quot;No&quot; a triangular hole will be drawn, otherwise the system it will pop  up a dialog asking you the number of segments that approximate to the  arc. The number of steps is automatically suggested by the program and  you can increase it if you wish, but keep it as small as possible to  reduce computation times.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Source</strong><br />
        You specify the position of a source drawing a segment from its real  position to the point it's aimed at. This is very important for the  correct computation of the sound field of directive sources. At this  point you'll be asked for the elevation of the source and of its target  point. The roll angle defines the rotation of the source axis with  respect for the floor plane (xy plane). At last you've to define the  full path of the source parameters file in the common open dialog. If  you keep the Shift key pressed while dragging the mouse pointer you'll  define a rectangular grid of sources. You define the density of the  grid in the dialog box, that will pop up after you have released the  mouse button.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Receiver</strong><br />
        A receiver represents a microphone, any measure equipment or a person.  The tracer results will always be relative to the receiver's position,  they shouldn't be considered the mean value of the room, so you should  use more than a receiver in order to analyze a room properly. The more  receiver you place the more precise results you get, but remember that  the resulting file will be much larger and the computation times  longer. You can place a receiver with the same steps described for a  source, but you'll be asked for the receiver elevation only because the  target point is always at the same height. This piece of information is  fundamental for the computation of LE parameter. You can draw a grid of  receivers following the same procedure used for sources.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Plant, Front and Side  views</strong><br />
        These are the standard orthogonal views that can be shown or hidden by  selecting the corresponding menu option. You can also activate them by  pressing &quot;P&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and &quot;S&quot; respectively.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>View</strong><br />
        This command displays a dialog box in which you can select some  parameters that will affect the rendering of some entities. In  particular you can show or hide all the receivers, the sources and  their respective orientation vectors.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Help</strong><br />
        This command displays this help page using your internet  browser.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>About</strong><br />
        This command displays the usual info box about the release  of the program.</p>
