  <div id="advert">
    <div class="feature">
      <p align="justify"><strong>Subdivision Level</strong><br />
This  parameter controls the number of pyramids in which will be subdivided  the balloon of each noise/sound source in the geometric model (.ray).  The minimum level is 0 and it corresponds to 8 pyramids only. For each  level increment the number of pyramids will be doubled, so the  following formula holds true:<br />
Pyramids = 8*2^Level<br />
Increasing the subdivision level, your results will be more precise,  but keep in mind that the computation time needed will increase  exponentially.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Time</strong><br />
        This is the number of seconds for which the path of the pyramids will  be followed. This parameter, together with the time resolution,  influences the size of the impulse response buffer, hence the amount of  RAM used by the program (see below) and the size of the resulting files  (.__a, .__b, ...).</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Time resolution</strong><br />
        This parameter specifies the size of each time slot (i.e. the  resolution) of the computed impulse response. The resolution needed is  tightly tied with the specific quantities you want to visualize with  Ramsete View, so it can be as small as 0.0001 seconds, or as big as the  Time parameter. Each time slot will eat 40 bytes of RAM, so if you want  to estimate the RAM needed by the computation, you can use this formula:<br />
        Bytes = 40 * (Time / Resolution + 1) * Receivers</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Humidity</strong><br />
        This is the percentage of humidity of the simulated room, so it can  range from 5% to 100%. If you don't know the actual value of the  humidity, you can safely assume it's 50%. The humidity affects the  attenuation of the acoustic signal propagating in the air.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Temperature</strong><br />
        The temperature of the air inside the model is expressed in Celsius  degrees, so it can assume negative values too. This parameters affects  the speed of the sound in the air.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Diffraction level</strong><br />
        When a spherical sound wave hits a wall with one or more free edges, it  can reach the receivers behind it, even if the line connecting them to  the image source is obstructed by the wall itself. The normal tracing  algorithms don't handle this particular configuration, so they simply  ignore the receivers behind the wall and reflect the wave as usual. The  full simulation of this physical behaviour would be very time  consuming, but we can reach a compromise between computation time and  simulation precision by limiting the number of diffractions to one or  two consecutive faces. In the worst case, i.e. two faces with four free  edges (two consecutive panels suspended in the air), you can have 16  energy contributions from a single wave. You should check this option  on only when your model contains a limited number of obstructing faces  with significant dimensions.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>History</strong><br />
        Normally the path of a pyramid is followed for the specified amount of  time, but sometimes it can be useful to stop the calculations after a  fixed number of reflections against the walls of the room. Checking  history checkbox you can fix the maximum number of reflections and  force the program to ignore the time limit. Anyway the time still  determines the size of the impulse response buffers but doesn't affect  the duration of the simulation. You can specify any number greater than  or equal to zero. Specifying a zero history, you force the computation  of the direct wave only.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Randomize after</strong><br />
        The simulation algorithm adopted by Ramsete always gives predictable  and repeatable results, for a given geometric configuration. Anyway,  especially when studying simple geometries, you could obtain some  unexpected artifacts in the resulting impulse response, due to the  unlucky relative positions of the sources and the walls. If after a  specified number of reflections, you add a small random deviation to  the pyramids, you could remove this artifacts, simulating also a sort  of diffusion effect (see below).</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save hits</strong><br />
        Ramsete View can visualize the path of the pyramids from the source to  every single receiver. In order to enable this useful option you have  to select the maximum number of hits (reflections) you want to store on  a special file (.@__) associated with the usual impulse response file.  This file can easily reach huge dimensions, so you must keep this  parameter as small as possible and you should also check often the free  space left on your hard disk.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Diffusion</strong><br />
        Ramsete 2 can also simulate the diffuse energy that normally is ignored  by the standard algorithms. Turning this option on gives you much more  realistic results, deleting the artifacts introduced by any  deterministic simulation, especially near the queue of the impulse  response. Of course you have to pay the price of a longer computation  time.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save diffuse hits</strong><br />
        Checking this option you can save also the energy contributions due to  diffusion effect in the same file in which are stored the normal hits.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save separated  sources</strong><br />
        When you check this option, the program will save a different result  file for each source present in the model. The file corresponding to  the first source will be named after the model name but it will have a  &quot;.__a&quot; extension. The second file will have a &quot;.__b&quot; extension and so  on ... If you uncheck this option all the results will be summed in a  single &quot;.___&quot; file.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save escaped rays</strong><br />
        Sometimes you may notice that some pyramids can't hit a surface, so  they &quot;escape&quot; from the modeled room. This behavior is normal in open  spaces, but should be avoided in closed ones. Saving the escaped rays  in the special file &quot;escaped.ray&quot; and loading it in Ramsete CAD, you  can have many hints on the unwanted holes present in your model.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>The following file  has been already processed</strong><br />
        This box informs you that the file whose name appears below the  checkbox itself, has already been processed, thus it will be ignored if  you press the &quot;Start&quot; button to begin the calculation. If you want to  force the recalculation of the results, simply uncheck this box.<br />
        Pressing this button you can add files to the list of &quot;.ray&quot; models to  be processed. Once the list is complete you can click on the individual  names and make modifications to any of the parameters described above,  so that each model can be processed differently with the appropriated  options. You can also remove one or more files from the list clicking  the &quot;Clear&quot; button.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Save Default</strong><br />
        This button saves all the current settings to the ramsete.ini so that  they can be retrieved on each execution of Ramsete, with no need of  inserting them from scratch each time.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Help</strong><br />
        This buttons displays this help page.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>About</strong><br />
        This button displays some info on the version of the Ramsete  Trace program.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Close</strong><br />
        This button terminates the tracing session.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Clear</strong><br />
        This button deletes the currently selected file from the  list of models to be processed.</p>
      <p align="justify"><strong>Start</strong></p>
      <div align="justify">This  button starts the computation of the impulse response of all the files  that haven't been processed yet. You will be prompted with the  following status window, that will display all the informations about  the parameters, the geometric model and the progress of the  computation. Pressing the &quot;Cancel&quot; button you can abort all the  calculations and return to the main window. </div>
