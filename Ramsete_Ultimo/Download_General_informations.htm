				<p><strong><a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/Ramsete/Ramsete302.zip">Ramsete 3.02 release</a></strong>  
				(05.01.2018) - No password required, also works in &quot;demo&quot; mode 
				without the new USB memory stick!</p>
				<p>Please, contact  the publisher <a href="http://www.spectra.it"> Spectra</a> for prices and other commercial info. Remember that THEY ARE THE PUBLISHER, we (the authors) are not responsible for the commercial stuff.</p>
				<p>If you want to test Ramsete, download the new version 3.02, which also works in &quot;demo&quot; mode...</p>
				<p>The new  version Ramsete 3.02 is also an &quot;evaluation copy&quot; of Ramsete. Unregistered users can test it, but are 
			not entitled to ask for support.</p> 
			<p>If you are an unregistered user of Ramsete, we still appreciate your feedback, but be prepared to the fact 
			that we will not necessarily provide answer to your problems.</p>
				<p>E-Mail: <a href="mailto:farina@unipr.it">farina@unipr.it</a></p>
				<p><strong>Please note:</strong> <br />
					Ramsete is NOT freeware! You need to purchase the hardware protection 
			key (the new USB memory stick, replacing old dongles) for making the program work without &quot;demo&quot; restrictions. 
			Please be aware that in &quot;demo&quot; mode Ramsete works with reduced accuracy, 
			so do not consider this to be a &quot;bug&quot; - you do not have to provide 
			feedback about this....</p>
				<p><strong>Crackers &amp;  Hackers</strong><br/>
					Cracking a program which was regularly downloaded from the publisher's  site IS LEGAL here in Italy (D.L. 29 
			December 1992, n. 518, 
			and subsequent modifications), provided  that you do not make any profit from it, 
			and that you do not redistribute the &quot;cracked&quot; software.</p>
				<p>We  are quite confident that our protection scheme 
			based on hardware dongles is safe enough for  avoiding crackers be able to break it. Nevertheless, it's your right to  try! Simply, please do not bother us with requests 
			about &quot;how to crack Ramsete&quot;...  you have to find it yourself, if you are a serious hacker/cracker it  
			should be no problem!</p>
				<p>So, if you are  able of decoding, installing and making it work, Ramsete is legally  yours! We simply ask you to send us an E-Mail, telling us how you was  successful in doing the crack. This is a good etiquette rule between  
			developers and hackers (and, of course, this will be useful for  improving our protection scheme).</p>
			<p>However, provided that you managed to crack the 
			protection scheme of Ramsete, you are only entitled to use it yourself, 
			for no-profit evaluation. Be aware that, according to the Italian law, 
			it is a crime to use cracked software for consultancy or other work 
			resulting in an income to you. Furthermore, it is a crime also 
			distributing the &quot;crack&quot; tool on P2P networks.</p>
