						<p><strong>File New</strong><br>
						This command saves the current drawing (if any) and 
						clears all active views allowing you to start a new 
						project.</p>
						<p><strong>File Open</strong><br>
						This command displays the usual Windows file selection 
						dialog box, in which you can select the name of the 
						desired .RAY or .DXF file.</p>
						<p><strong>Merge</strong><br>
						This command if analogous to the File Open option, the 
						unique difference is the fact that the selected file is 
						appended to the current model instead of replacing it.</p>
						<p><strong>Save</strong><br>
						This command saves the current drawing using the usual 
						Windows dialog box in which you can choose the name of 
						file, the first time you save it. You can also choose to 
						save the model in DXF format. When you save large 
						projects you'll be asked for checking the duplicates 
						entities you could have created accidentally or imported 
						from less than perfect DXF files. If the program finds 
						such entities you can safely delete them. You can 
						perform this task manually using the Select duplicates 
						command.</p>
						<p><strong>Save as</strong><br>
						This command allows you to save the current model with a 
						different name, using the Window dialog box. You can 
						also choose to save the model in DXF format: see the 
						File Open option for the details.</p>
						<p><strong>Base map</strong><br>
						This command reads a DXF file, containing the 2D 
						representation of the base map of the model. You can 
						draw actual walls following the resulting gray lines on 
						the background<br>
						Dxf in<br>
						This command allows you to import a DXF file. You should 
						be informed about the guidelines you should follow in 
						order to attain the best results:</p>
						<p>&nbsp;- 3DFACE entities will be recognized 
						as walls, floors or ceilings, according to their 
						orientation. If a 3DFACE is included in another 3DFACE 
						it will be considered as a door or a window.<br>
						&nbsp;- POLYLINE entities will be converted in holes in the 
						nearest wall.<br>
						&nbsp;- LINE entities (preferably in the RECEIVERS layer) 
						will be converted in receivers placed on the starting 
						point and oriented in the same direction of the segment.<br>
						&nbsp;- ATTDEF entities (preferably in the SOURCES layer) 
						will be converted in sources placed on the starting 
						point and oriented in the same direction of the segment.</p>
						<p>If you want to learn all the details 
						about the DXF format accepted by Ramsete, you should 
						simply use the Dxf out command and analize the output 
						with a text editor.</p>
						<p><strong>Dxf out</strong><br>
						This command exports the current drawing in DXF format. 
						You can modify the DXF file using any DXF enabled tool. 
						Of course you can also import it again in Ramsete CAD 
						using the Dxf in command.</p>
						<p><strong>Project notes</strong><br>
						Using this command you can write some text notes to be 
						attached to the project</p>
						<p><strong>Exit</strong><br>
						This command exits the program after asking you to save 
						the current drawing.</p>
						<p><strong>Cut</strong><br>
						This command deletes the currently selected entities and 
						copies them into the clipboard. You can paste them in 
						another drawing if you start a second instance of 
						Ramsete CAD.</p>
						<p><strong>Copy</strong><br>
						This command copies all the selected entities into the 
						clipboard. You can paste them in another drawing if you 
						start a second instance of Ramsete CAD.</p>
						<p><strong>Paste</strong><br>
						If you saved something into the clipboard, using a Cut 
						or Copy command, you can paste those entities in the 
						current drawing.</p>
						<p><strong>Duplicate</strong><br>
						This command is totally equivalent to the Copy and Paste 
						command sequence. The final effect is the duplication of 
						all the selected entities. At this point you should 
						immediately move them in another location. If you don't 
						do that you would obtain an inconsistent model, that 
						could give unpredictable results.</p>
						<p><strong>Delete</strong><br>
						This command deletes definitively the currently selected 
						entities. You can retrieve them only using the command.</p>
						<p><strong>Undo</strong><br>
						You can use this command to cancel the effects of your 
						last action. For example: if you deleted a wall by 
						accident, Undo will make it to reappear . You can undo 
						the last ten actions (subject to change). If your system 
						performs too badly, you can disable the Undo command in 
						the Options menu.</p>
						<p><strong>Redo</strong><br>
						This command nullifies the effects of the preceding undo 
						command: i.e. it repeats the last action that you 
						accidentally undone.</p>
						<p><strong>Resize</strong><br>
						This command displays a dialog box by which you can 
						specify a scaling factor that will affect all the 
						selected entities.<br>
						<strong>Properties</strong><br>
						This command displays a dialog box by which you can edit 
						the properties of the select items</p>
						<p><strong>Geometry</strong><br>
						This command displays a dialog box that shows the 
						geometric properties of the selected objects.</p>
						<p><strong>Select All Entities</strong><br>
						This command selects all the model entities.</p>
						<p><strong>Select Material</strong><br>
						This command selects all entities made of a particular 
						material, chosen from the list of all availabe 
						materials.</p>
						<p><strong>Select Obstructing</strong><br>
						This command displays a dialog box by which you can 
						select obstructing faces in three modes:</p>
						<p>&nbsp;- Select all obstructing faces<br>
						&nbsp;- Select faces that should be obstructing<br>
						&nbsp;- Assign automatically the obstructing flag</p>
						<p>The first option simply scans the 
						model and selects all the faces that has been declared 
						as obstructing.<br>
						The second option tries to determine euristically which 
						faces should be declared as obstructing<br>
						The third option performs the same task of the second 
						but automatically assigns the obstructing flag to the 
						selected faces.</p>
						<p><strong>Select Monopermeable</strong><br>
						This command selects all the surfaces that has been 
						declared as monopermeable. Usually you should use this 
						special faces in order to enclose noise sources. The 
						tracer will follow the path of the sound waves that will 
						trespass the monopermeable faces only on the very first 
						impact. On successive impacts they will be reflected as 
						usual.</p>
						<p><strong>Toggle all receivers</strong><br>
						This commands selects or deselects all the receivers 
						present in the model.</p>
						<p><strong>Toggle all sources</strong><br>
						This commands selects or deselects all the sources 
						present in the model.</p>
						<p><strong>Advanced</strong><br>
						This command displays a list of all the materials used 
						in the model. If you click on a item of the list, all 
						the corresponding entities will be colored.</p>
						<p><strong>Select Duplicates</strong><br>
						This command scans the entire model for duplicate 
						entities, i.e. objects with the identical geometric 
						position of others. This objects can be source of 
						unpredictable results and so you should try to eliminate 
						them all. Each time you save a model, it will checked 
						for duplicates anyway.</p>
						<p><strong>Unselect all</strong><br>
						This commands unselects all the currently selected 
						entities.</p>
						<p><strong>Pick</strong><br>
						This is the selection tool by which you can select or 
						deselect the entities you click onto. In order to select 
						a face you must click nearby its edges, not inside it! 
						You can also select rectangular areas by dragging the 
						mouse pointer and keeping the left button pressed, in 
						this way all the entities inside the rectangle will be 
						selected. You can use this tool in any view of the 
						model.</p>
						<p><strong>Lens</strong><br>
						Using the lens tool you can zoom in any detail of the 
						model in any view. If you click the left mouse button 
						you'll zoom in the area surrounding the selected point. 
						If you click the right mouse button you'll return to the 
						standard view of the entire model. You can also zoom 
						rectangular areas by dragging the mouse pointer and 
						keeping the left button pressed</p>
						<p><strong>Move</strong><br>
						Once you have selected some entities you can use this 
						command in order to specify an offset to be applied to 
						them. You should simply click on a chosen point and drag 
						the mouse to another target point. When you'll release 
						the mouse button, all selected entities will be move 
						accordingly.</p>
						<p><strong>Mirror</strong><br>
						This command allows you to mirror all the selected 
						entities with respect to a plane. You specify this 
						mirroring plane by defining a line: simply click on the 
						starting point and then drag the mouse pointer on the 
						final point. Now you'll be asked for the deletion of the 
						selected entities that will be mirrored anyway.</p>
						<p><strong>Rotate</strong><br>
						This command allows you to rotate all the selected 
						entities around a specified axis. You should click on 
						the center of the rotation an specify the desired angle 
						in degrees.</p>
						<p><strong>Floor</strong><br>
						Usually this is the very first tool you should use in 
						order to define the floor for the entire project. 
						Normally you'll draw a rectangle by simply dragging the 
						mouse pointer on the plan view.</p>
						<p><strong>Roof</strong><br>
						The procedure to draw a roof is very similar to the one 
						used for the floor, but when you've drawn the rectangle 
						you'll be prompted for the elevations of three points, 
						the fourth we'll be computed automatically.</p>
						<p><strong>Wall</strong><br>
						In the plant view you can draw a wall as a segment, in 
						the front or side views you'll draw a rectangle. When 
						you've placed the segment you'll be asked for the 
						minimum and maximum elevation of the wall. In the side 
						or front view you'll be prompted for the missing 
						coordinate with the standard dialog box.</p>
						<p><strong>Box</strong><br>
						This tool allows the creation of closed boxes. You 
						should click one time in the position of each vertex of 
						the polygonal base. Then, when you click again on the 
						first vertex, you'll be asked for the height of the box 
						and you'll be able to specify if you want a floor and a 
						roof on it.</p>
						<p><strong>Boxes</strong><br>
						If you want to draw a series of connected boxes you have 
						simply to click on the junction points. As soon as you 
						click on the starting point you will be prompted for the 
						box parameters. Then, while you click on the following 
						points, the program will draw the boxes. In order to 
						terminate the procedure, you should click two times on 
						the last point.</p>
						<p><strong>Cylinder</strong><br>
						In order to draw a cylinder you have to define the 
						circumference arc of its base clicking onto three points 
						to define the arc itself limits. If you want to draw a 
						complete circle you should click onto two points 
						defining the diameter and click on the first point again 
						to finish. At this point you'll have to insert the 
						cylinder elevations in the dialog box.</p>
						<p><strong>Sphere</strong><br>
						The procedure that defines a spherical surface is 
						identical to the one we have described for the cylinder. 
						This tool can't draw a complete sphere but only a 
						fraction of it, but you can draw a semi-sphere and use 
						the mirror tool in order to have the complete work done.</p>
						<p><strong>Pipe</strong><br>
						The procedure to draw pipelines is identical to the one 
						described for boxes. You'll be asked for the radius of 
						the pipe as soon as you click on the starting point.</p>
						<p><strong>Door</strong><br>
						When you want to draw a door you have to select the wall 
						that it belongs to and click on the position in which 
						you want to place it. Now you have to specify the door 
						dimensions in the dialog box.</p>
						<p><strong>Window</strong><br>
						The procedure that creates a window is identical to the 
						one we have described for creating a door. The only 
						difference is that you have to input also the elevation 
						of the window.</p>
						<p><strong>Hole</strong><br>
						This tool allows you to make holes into walls. First of 
						all you should select the wall you want to perforate, 
						then you describe a closed polygon clicking on its 
						vertices. The last point of the polygon should coincide 
						with the first one. If you draw a polygon with three 
						vertices only you'll be asked if you are trying to draw 
						an arc: if you answer &quot;No&quot; a triangular hole will be 
						drawn, otherwise the system it will pop up a dialog 
						asking you the number of segments that approximate to 
						the arc. The number of steps is automatically suggested 
						by the program and you can increase it if you wish, but 
						keep it as small as possible to reduce computation 
						times.</p>
						<p><strong>Source</strong><br>
						You specify the position of a source drawing a segment 
						from its real position to the point it's aimed at. This 
						is very important for the correct computation of the 
						sound field of directive sources. At this point you'll 
						be asked for the elevation of the source and of its 
						target point. The roll angle defines the rotation of the 
						source axis with respect for the floor plane (xy plane). 
						At last you've to define the full path of the source 
						parameters file in the common open dialog. If you keep 
						the Shift key pressed while dragging the mouse pointer 
						you'll define a rectangular grid of sources. You define 
						the density of the grid in the dialog box, that will pop 
						up after you have released the mouse button.</p>
						<p><strong>Receiver</strong><br>
						A receiver represents a microphone, any measure 
						equipment or a person. The tracer results will always be 
						relative to the receiver's position, they shouldn't be 
						considered the mean value of the room, so you should use 
						more than a receiver in order to analyze a room 
						properly. The more receiver you place the more precise 
						results you get, but remember that the resulting file 
						will be much larger and the computation times longer. 
						You can place a receiver with the same steps described 
						for a source, but you'll be asked for the receiver 
						elevation only because the target point is always at the 
						same height. This piece of information is fundamental 
						for the computation of LE parameter. You can draw a grid 
						of receivers following the same procedure used for 
						sources.</p>
						<p><strong>Plant, Front and Side views</strong><br>
						These are the standard orthogonal views that can be 
						shown or hidden by selecting the corresponding menu 
						option. You can also activate them by pressing &quot;P&quot;, &quot;F&quot; 
						and &quot;S&quot; respectively.</p>
						<p><strong>View</strong><br>
						This command displays a dialog box in which you can 
						select some parameters that will affect the rendering of 
						some entities. In particular you can show or hide all 
						the receivers, the sources and their respective 
						orientation vectors.</p>
						<p><strong>Help</strong><br>
						This command displays this help page using your internet 
						browser.</p>
						<p><strong>About</strong><br>
						This command displays the usual info box about the 
						release of the program</p>
