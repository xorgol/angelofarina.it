						<p><strong>
						Subdivision Level</strong><br>
						This parameter controls the number of pyramids in which 
						will be subdivided the balloon of each noise/sound 
						source in the geometric model (.ray). The minimum level 
						is 0 and it corresponds to 8 pyramids only. For each 
						level increment the number of pyramids will be doubled, 
						so the following formula holds true:<br>
						Pyramids = 8*2^Level<br>
						Increasing the subdivision level, your results will be 
						more precise, but keep in mind that the computation time 
						needed will increase exponentially.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Time</strong><br>
						This is the number of seconds for which the path of the 
						pyramids will be followed. This parameter, together with 
						the time resolution, influences the size of the impulse 
						response buffer, hence the amount of RAM used by the 
						program (see below) and the size of the resulting files 
						(.__a, .__b, ...).</p>
						<p><strong>
						Time resolution</strong><br>
						This parameter specifies the size of each time slot 
						(i.e. the resolution) of the computed impulse response. 
						The resolution needed is tightly tied with the specific 
						quantities you want to visualize with Ramsete View, so 
						it can be as small as 0.0001 seconds, or as big as the 
						Time parameter. Each time slot will eat 40 bytes of RAM, 
						so if you want to estimate the RAM needed by the 
						computation, you can use this formula:<br>
						Bytes = 40 * (Time / Resolution + 1) * Receivers</p>
						<p><strong>
						Humidity</strong><br>
						This is the percentage of humidity of the simulated 
						room, so it can range from 5% to 100%. If you don't know 
						the actual value of the humidity, you can safely assume 
						it's 50%. The humidity affects the attenuation of the 
						acoustic signal propagating in the air.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Temperature</strong><br>
						The temperature of the air inside the model is expressed 
						in Celsius degrees, so it can assume negative values 
						too. This parameters affects the speed of the sound in 
						the air.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Diffraction level</strong><br>
						When a spherical sound wave hits a wall with one or more 
						free edges, it can reach the receivers behind it, even 
						if the line connecting them to the image source is 
						obstructed by the wall itself. The normal tracing 
						algorithms don't handle this particular configuration, 
						so they simply ignore the receivers behind the wall and 
						reflect the wave as usual. The full simulation of this 
						physical behaviour would be very time consuming, but we 
						can reach a compromise between computation time and 
						simulation precision by limiting the number of 
						diffractions to one or two consecutive faces. In the 
						worst case, i.e. two faces with four free edges (two 
						consecutive panels suspended in the air), you can have 
						16 energy contributions from a single wave. You should 
						check this option on only when your model contains a 
						limited number of obstructing faces with significant 
						dimensions.</p>
						<p><strong>
						History</strong><br>
						Normally the path of a pyramid is followed for the 
						specified amount of time, but sometimes it can be useful 
						to stop the calculations after a fixed number of 
						reflections against the walls of the room. Checking 
						history checkbox you can fix the maximum number of 
						reflections and force the program to ignore the time 
						limit. Anyway the time still determines the size of the 
						impulse response buffers but doesn't affect the duration 
						of the simulation. You can specify any number greater 
						than or equal to zero. Specifying a zero history, you 
						force the computation of the direct wave only.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Randomize after</strong><br>
						The simulation algorithm adopted by Ramsete always gives 
						predictable and repeatable results, for a given 
						geometric configuration. Anyway, especially when 
						studying simple geometries, you could obtain some 
						unexpected artifacts in the resulting impulse response, 
						due to the unlucky relative positions of the sources and 
						the walls. If after a specified number of reflections, 
						you add a small random deviation to the pyramids, you 
						could remove this artifacts, simulating also a sort of 
						diffusion effect (see below).</p>
						<p><strong>
						Save hits</strong><br>
						Ramsete View can visualize the path of the pyramids from 
						the source to every single receiver. In order to enable 
						this useful option you have to select the maximum number 
						of hits (reflections) you want to store on a special 
						file (.@__) associated with the usual impulse response 
						file. This file can easily reach huge dimensions, so you 
						must keep this parameter as small as possible and you 
						should also check often the free space left on your hard 
						disk.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Diffusion</strong><br>
						Ramsete 2 can also simulate the diffuse energy that 
						normally is ignored by the standard algorithms. Turning 
						this option on gives you much more realistic results, 
						deleting the artifacts introduced by any deterministic 
						simulation, especially near the queue of the impulse 
						response. Of course you have to pay the price of a 
						longer computation time.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Save diffuse hits</strong><br>
						Checking this option you can save also the energy 
						contributions due to diffusion effect in the same file 
						in which are stored the normal hits.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Save separated sources</strong><br>
						When you check this option, the program will save a 
						different result file for each source present in the 
						model. The file corresponding to the first source will 
						be named after the model name but it will have a &quot;.__a&quot; 
						extension. The second file will have a &quot;.__b&quot; extension 
						and so on ... If you uncheck this option all the results 
						will be summed in a single &quot;.___&quot; file.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Save escaped rays</strong><br>
						Sometimes you may notice that some pyramids can't hit a 
						surface, so they &quot;escape&quot; from the modeled room. This 
						behavior is normal in open spaces, but should be avoided 
						in closed ones. Saving the escaped rays in the special 
						file &quot;escaped.ray&quot; and loading it in Ramsete CAD, you 
						can have many hints on the unwanted holes present in 
						your model.</p>
						<p><strong>
						The following file has been already 
						processed</strong><br>
						This box informs you that the file whose name appears 
						below the checkbox itself, has already been processed, 
						thus it will be ignored if you press the &quot;Start&quot; button 
						to begin the calculation. If you want to force the 
						recalculation of the results, simply uncheck this box.<br>
						Pressing this button you can add files to the list of 
						&quot;.ray&quot; models to be processed. Once the list is complete 
						you can click on the individual names and make 
						modifications to any of the parameters described above, 
						so that each model can be processed differently with the 
						appropriated options. You can also remove one or more 
						files from the list clicking the &quot;Clear&quot; button.</p>
						<p><strong>
						Save Default</strong><br>
						This button saves all the current settings to the 
						ramsete.ini so that they can be retrieved on each 
						execution of Ramsete, with no need of inserting them 
						from scratch each time.</p>
						<p><strong>

							<p>This button starts the 
							computation of the impulse response of all the files 
							that haven't been processed yet. You will be 
							prompted with the following status window, that will 
							display all the informations about the parameters, 
							the geometric model and the progress of the 
							computation. Pressing the &quot;Cancel&quot; button you can 
							abort all the calculations and return to the main 
							window.</p>
