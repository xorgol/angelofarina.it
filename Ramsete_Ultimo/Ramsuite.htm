          During then suite development  priority has been given to the functional structure of&nbsp; the modeling  system and to ease the input data process also to not experienced and  skilful users.</td>

          <td> RamSuite in arranged to handle native XML data, but specific conversion  features allow to automatically import exchange data files (e.g. DXF).  Development makes use of Open Source libraries which allow porting with  heterogeneous operating systems like Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  Simulation set-up is arranged by the user thanks to the program window,  where input data can be directly and easily introduced; batch  processing can be instead distributed on many computers of the same  local area network. Output data of any simulations can be displayed  immediately on the program window or can be imported in Surfer (&reg;  Golden Software inc.), a widespread program for maps interpolation and  processing.

This software, grown out of the experiences of development  required by many Italian Government agencies few years ago, is now  evolving to make his use public.
