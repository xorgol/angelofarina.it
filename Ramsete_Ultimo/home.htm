			<h2>Ramsete 3.02 Novel Full Release (with bugfix) is now available <br>(05/01/2018)!!!</h2>

			<h3>Please go to the
			<a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/Ramsete">
			download directory</a> and get the 
			new complete installation package - no 
			password is required, and the program works 
			in &quot;demo mode&quot; even without the new USB memory stick!</h3>
			<p>Ramsete 
			has been 
			the first publicly available software for 
			acoustical simulations based 
			on the Pyramid Tracing computing scheme, 
			which is quite different from traditional 
			Ray Tracing or Cone Tracing schemes. </p>
			
			<p >Briefly, the Pyramid 
			Tracing algorithm is capable of solving the 
			sound propagation problems in large 
			enclosures or outdoors, following the 
			Geometrical Acoustics assumptions. It takes 
			into account specular and diffuse reflections over sound 
			absorbing surfaces, being the absorption 
			coefficient and the scattering coefficient defined over 10 octave bands. 
			Furthermore, it takes into account 
			diffraction over free edges of screens, 
			energy passing through the panels (sound 
			insulation), holes in large surfaces, 
			windows or doors made of a material 
			different from the surrounding surface.</p>

			<p>Ramsete is also equipped with
			a powerful tool for auralization: the results of the
			simulation can be converted in a pressure impulse response, emulating
			carefully an IR measured with an omnidirectional microphone
			or with a binaural dummy head. By convolving anechoic speech or music
			with these IRs, one gets an audible rendering of the acoustical
			behaviour of a design.</p>
