<font face="Arial"><b>X-volver is a VST plugin running on WIN32 and OSX 
multichannel host programs,<br>
performing matrix convolution of audio signals with up to 32 inputs and 32 
outputs</b></font></h2>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">You can
<a href="http://www.angelofarina.it/Public/Xvolver/">download X-volver and a 
collection of filter matrices here</a>. X-volver is free for personal usage.
<a href="mailto:farina@unipr.it?subject=X-volver">Contact the author</a> for 
professional usage.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">X-volver can be hosted inside a large number of sound 
processing programs, but for multichannel operation (that is, more than 2 
inputs, 2 outputs) you need to employ a truly-multichannel host program. 
Unfortunately most sound processing programs and DAWs support only soundtracks 
with a limited number of audio channels (typically 2, 4 or 6 at most). Instead 
X-volver can operate with up to 32 channels (and the shortcoming version will go 
up to 64), so your host program is better if capable of such large channel 
counts. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Furthermore, Xvolver can produce an output stream having a 
different channel number than the input stream, and only a few audio processing 
programs allow for this possibility.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">We recommend the usage of &quot;graphical&quot; sound processing programs, such as 
Plogue Bidule, Audio Mulch, PureData, Max-Msp. X-volver can also be employed 
inside traditional DAW programs, such as Reaper, but this makes quite more 
difficult to understand the signal paths.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This is a typical screenshot of Plogue Bidule, where an 
instance of X-volver is employed for processing a 4-channels audio file and 
converting it to another 4-channels audio file, employing a filter matrix of 4x4 
(16) FIR filters:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv2.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When X-volver is first instanced, under Windows, it asks 
for the number of input and output channels:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv3.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This does not happens on the Mac version, where the number 
of channels must be changed inside X-volver, then it must be closed and opened 
again for the new setting to become effective.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">After instancing X-volver and connecting its 4 inputs 
(from above) and its 4 outputs (to below), you can click on it for opening its 
user's interface:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv4.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The largest part of the GUI contains the filter matrix, in 
this case a 4x4 matrix, where the impulse responses (IRs, also called FIRs) of 
the filters have to be loaded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This matrix contains 16 cells, numbered from (1,1) to 
(4,4). You must remember that COLUMNS=INPUTS, ROWS=OUTPUTS.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">So the signal coming out from X-volver on channel 1 will 
be the sum of the convolutions of the 4 inputs with the 4 filters displayed in 
the first row:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Out(1) = In(1)*f(1,1) + In(2)*f(1,2) + In(3)*f(1,3) + 
In(4)*f(1,4).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">For populating the matrix of FIR filters you have three 
ways:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1) If Mode is set to &quot;<b>IR mono</b>&quot;, first write in the 
IR size field the proper length (in samples) of the impulse responses you plan 
to use (16384, in the example below). Then navigate to a directory containing 
the individual filters (each saved in a mono WAV file) by pressing the button 
labelled [...], and then drag-and-drop these filters to each cell of the matrix, 
as shown here during the drag-and-drop operation:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv5.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When the matrix is complete, you can save it in a single 
multichannel WAV file pressing the PACK button:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv6.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">It is recommended to always save in 32 bit float format, 
&quot;IR multi&quot; (which means complete matrix, whilst &quot;IR 1-TO-1&quot; means to save only 
the diagonal of the matrix).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) If a filter matrix is already available, packed in a 
single multichannel WAV file, you can select the Mode labelled &quot;<b>IR multi</b>&quot; 
in X-volver. At this point on the left you only see the WAV files having the 
&quot;correct&quot; number of channels (4, in this case), and you can just select the one to 
load. No drag-and-drop is required when in IR-multi mode, just selecting the WAV 
file automatically loads the full matrix, as shown here:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv7.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) Finally, if Mode is set to &quot;<b>IR 1-to-1</b>&quot;, only the 
diagonal of the filter matrix is processed (which means that each output is 
equal to the corresponding input, convolved with its FIR filter placed in the 
cell in the diagonal):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv8.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">When operating in this mode, X-volver behaves as several 
other convolvers already widely employed, such as Voxengo Pristine Space. Matrix mode is peculiar to X-volver.</font></p>
<hr>
<p><font face="Arial">Of course you can create your own FIR filter matrix 
assembling the individual FIRs directy in a program such as Audacity. Remember 
to set, in the preferences of Audacity, the option &quot;Use custom mix&quot; for 
exporting a true multichannel file; by default, Audacity downmixes everything to 
stereo or mono...</font></p>
<p><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv4.jpg"></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Here you see for example 
the filter matrix employed above when it was being edited in Audacity:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">
<img border="0" src="Public/B-format/A2B-conversion/A2B-images/A2B-Xv10.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Just remember that in Audacity you have to specify 
&quot;XvMulti&quot; in the Comments, if you want that your filter matrix is recognized 
properly by the MAC-OSX version of X-volver (the Windows version does not 
require this):</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><img border="0" src="X-volver-pictures/X-volv11.jpg"></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Final trick: set the processing gain properly, as often 
the convolution operation can result in a significant boost in the amplitude of 
the signals, which can clip and get distorted. No auto-gain is provided, so it 
is up to the user to ensure that the audio signal is not clipped, by adjusting 
properly the Out gain control.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial"><b>Notes:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">1) The graphical display of the waveform of each filter 
undersamples the real waveform, so do not expect to see all the peaks and 
valleys</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">2) The graphical display of the spectrum of the selected 
FIR filter is also low-resolution, so again do not expect to see all the peaks 
and valleys</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">3) The choice of IR size and the &quot;Zero Latency&quot; option 
affect the CPU usage and the processing latency. On modern computers you can 
operate massive convolutions, with small CPU usage and reasonably low latency, 
but if you exceed in your requirements the audio will drop or you will get other 
nasty artifacts.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And

of using X-volver for performing conversion between A-format and B-format.</font></p>
