<ul>
	<li>Angelo graduated at the University of Bologna in 1982 (5-years &quot;laurea&quot; 
	<b>degree in Civil Engineering</b>);</li>
	<li>At the same University he got a <b>Ph.D. in Technical Physics</b> in 1987.
In both cases the theses were about Applied Acoustics topics. </li>
	<li>In
1986 he became <b>Researcher in Environmental Technical Physics</b>, initally at 
	the University of Bologna, and since March 1992 at the University of Parma.
	</li>
	<li>He became <b>Associated Professor in Environmental
Technical Physics </b>on 1st November 1998 at the University of Parma, and since then he is holding courses of 
Technical Physics at the faculties of Engineering, Architecture and Medicine.</li>
	<li>Since 1st May 2005 he is <b>Full Professor in Environmental Technical Physics</b>, 
	and now teaches Applied Acoustics at the Faculty of Engineering of the 
	University of Parma</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="OldCourses.htm">See here</a> for a list of the courses hold by 
Angelo Farina.</p>
<p>Angelo conducted wide and deep researches in almost all the fields of 
Acoustics, and particularly he worked on digital signal
processing techniques for acustical measuremebts and audio effects, and on numerical models
for the sound field estimation in closed and open spaces.</p>

<p>In more detail, he developed new measurement techniques, based
on the employ of binary pseudo-random signals (MLS) and more recently on 
exponentially swept sinusoidal signals; these allow
for the easy measurement of the sound propagation in working
places, outdoors, and in concert halls and auditoriums.
Furthermore, these new techniques made it possible to measure
&quot;in situ&quot; the acoustical properties of materials, with
main application in the evaluation of the sound absorption
coefficient and sound reduction index of porous road surfaces and
noise shields. </p>

<p>Angelo has coded a lot of software for the design of theatres
and concert halls, sound diffusion systems, workplaces and for
the dimensioning of sound reduction devices both indoors and
outdoors. Some of these programs were released as commercial
software, published both in Italy and in the other countries: at
the beginning of 1993, <a href="HTTP://www.ramsete.com">RAMSETE </a>was
launched. It is a Pyramid Tracing program for the simulation of
the sound propagation in closed spaces and outdoors. One year
later, <a href="HTTP://www.aurora-plugins.com">AURORA</a> was
released: it is a suite of software tools which makes it possible
to measure impulse responses or to recover them from Ramsete
simulations, and to use them as filters for making Virtual
Acoustics Reality simulations (auralisations). The coupling of
the two programs produces audible simulations (on headphones or a
suitable set of loudspeaker) of the various design hypotheses,
starting from anechoic speech, music or noise. </p>
<p>He took part to a number of Environmental Impact Evaluations
of large infrastructure projects, co-operating particularly with
experts of chemical pollution in the cases of Urban Wastes
Discharges, Waste Incineration Plants, and roads or railways. In
many cases, at the end of the impact evaluation procedure, he
designed the sound reduction devices, which are typically noise
screens for the shielding of fixed sources or vehicles.</p>

<p>Angelo was the acoustical designer of dozens of buildings and sound reduction 
plans, both in environmental and industrial cases. Some were along primary 
highways and railways: among these, three cases have to be outlined: noise screens along the &quot;Autovie
Venete&quot; highway, near Siziana (TS, Italy),&nbsp; Ferrara-Suzzara railway between Poggiorusco
and Ferrara and the high-speed train interconnection inside Parma. </p>

<p>In parallel with the design activity, he made a large number
of qualification tests, in laboratory and in situ, of building
elements for noise screens, releasing certifications according
with UNI, AFNOR, ISO, DIN standards and with the acceptation
procedures of the &quot;Societ� Autostrade&quot; (Italian
Highway) and FF.S. (Italian State Railways). </p>

<p>He was acoustic consultant in more than 20 italian theatres, churches and 
sport arenas:&nbsp; he designed the acoustical correction of Teatro
Filarmonico in Verona, of Roman Amphitheatre in Verona, of Nuovo
Teatro Comunale in Cagliari, of Pala De' Andr� in Ravenna, of
Teatro Farnese in Parma, of Sport Arena di Modena, of &quot;Buero
Vallejo&quot; Theatre in Alcorcon (Madrid), of Teatro Comunale in
Orvieto and in many other rooms. He developed an innovative
approach to the use of ancient churches as multi-function
auditoriums, with experience in nearly 10 cases, amond which the
Aula Magna S.Lucia in Bologna and the S.Domenico basilica in
Foligno. Recently he designed the acoustics of the new &quot;PalaFiumara&quot; in Genoa, 
the first Italian &quot;sport arena&quot; which was designed and built specifically for 
the usage as a large, multipurpose concert hall.</p>

<p>Angelo was deeply involved in the normative activity,
taking part to the UNI Acoustical Commission and to some CEN,
ISO and AES working groups. This activity was supported by a long
experience in laboratory tests and certification.</p>

<p>He was consultant of the Italian Environment Ministry, SIAR
(Air Noise Pollution Service) during a DISIA project for the
acoustical recovery of urban areas. During this activity, he
developed two innovative simulation programs for the acoustic
mapping of urban areas (CITYMAP) and for the detail evaluation of
the sound reduction devices (DISIAPYR). </p>
<p>In 1995, Angelo released the <a href="Public/Disia/">DISIA</a> package, a 
suite of software tools for noise mapping in urban areas (wide-range and 
detail), including industrial sources, road noise and railway/tramway noise. 
This software was developed under contract with the Italian Minstry for the 
Environment, and has been for years the &quot;reference&quot; computer model employed 
freely by Italian public administrations, schools and universities. In August 
2005, however, Italy adopted the European Council Directive on Noise Planning, 
and consequently now the &quot;official&quot; ad-interim noise prediction algorithms to be 
used in Italy are the French &quot;Cetur&quot; model (road noise), the Dutch railway 
model, and ISO 9613 for industrial sources.</p>

<p>Angelo is effective member of the Italian Acoustics
Association (AIA) and of the Audio Engineering Society (AES). </p>

<p>At the University of Parma, he contributed to the development
of the acoustics laboratories; he actually is responsible of them
after the transfer of the founder, prof. Roberto Pompoli. These
laboratories are equipped with high level instrumentation and
facilities, making it possible to execute any kind of acoustical
investigation and to release official certifications. In these
laboratories, Angelo developed innovative measuring techniques
and software &quot;virtual instruments&quot;, which place the
University of Parma in a position of absolute excellence in the world. </p>

<p>Angelo is author of more than <a href="Public/Papers/list_pub.htm">240
scientific papers</a>; about 2/3 of them are in English, and were
presented at international conferences and/or printed in peer-reviewed scientifc 
journals. The actual
scientific activity is related principally with&nbsp;
numerical modelling techniques, applied to the <a href="/ASK">optimisation of sound systems on vehicles</a>,
and to the measurement of the acoustical impulse responses of theaters and 
concert halls, providing the filters to be employed in modern convolution 
software plugins, such as the new
<a href="http://www.waves.com">Waves IR-1 plugin</a>. </p>
